}

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header { 
	background-color: #FFFFFF; 
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background-color: #FFFFCC; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	line-height: 30px;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #mainContent {
	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer { 
	padding: 0 10px; /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear above it. */
	background-color: #FFFFFF;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */
}

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}

    <h1>We Walk! 2010 Feedback</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2010 is the second year for the We Walk! Marathon. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Many of you 
	gave us wonderful comments and suggestions about the event. We want to make 
	the next event better by learning from this year&#39;s event. So, if you have 
	anything you especially liked, or anything that you&#39;d like changed, please 
	let us know. Even if you told us on the day of the race, it would be good to 
	drop us a note anyway, as we may have forgotten it with what else was going 
	on. Just send an e-mail to:
	<a href="mailto:info@walkonmn.org?subject=Feedback: We Walk! Marathon & Half">
	info@walkonmn.org</a>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We put every e-mail here. We only delete personal issues that are outside 
	the organization of the event. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>The e-mail feedback we received so far:</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
	<p>WOW THAT WAS FUN.. And I hardly even hurt.. What could be better ? I hope 
	that you have managed to survive too. </p>
	<p>Here is the link to the photos that Leslie took. Not much in the way of 
	captions. Iâ€™ll try to get to that later. There are two albums for the 
	Marathon and Half. Each has the start and one water stop. Leslie tried as 
	much as she could to get a photo of everyone, it was quite a crowd. </p>

	<hr>
	<p>Please pass on my thanks to Leslie for the wonderful pictures! I down 
	loaded a number of them to save. The photos seem to have been a great 
	back-up to verifying participant information. I&#39;m sure Bruce and Dave 
	appreciated the feedback Will and Leslie provided on the finish results. </p>

	<hr>
	<p>Thanks to you and Dave for all your work - I spoke with the manager at Bo 
	Diddley&#39;s yesterday - just a thought for next year - she figured out we 
	could do a 6 inch sub for everyone - she could do it for $3.15 per sub and 
	do it the morning-of if we needeed 100 to 125 subs or whatever. The sandwich 
	with an apple, a drink and Bob&#39;s cookies would be a nice little alternative 
	lunch for everyone. What do you think? </p>

	<hr>
	<p>Well done fellows, great event!! </p>
	<p>I put a dollar in the dorm drink machine Fri late afternoon, thinking 
	drinks were a dollar. </p>
	<p>I left my 50 State cap in St Joseph. I dropped it; fellows behind me 
	(they finished ahead) picked it up and left it at an aid station. It wasn&#39;t 
	at the finish line and I had a plane to catch. I donate it to the event. </p>
	<p>Thank you again for an fine event for my 100th marathon (or over 
	distance)!!!!!! </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Partial Response from Bruce - As we sort through all the stuff that 
		Dave and I brought back from the event, we&#39;ll look for your hat. Dave 
		and I appreciate the effort that went into earning a 50 state cap (1 
		marathon in each state). You&#39;ll get it back if we find it. As for the $1 
		you contributed to the pop machine. I am sure the next purchaser 
		appreciated your donation to the price of their can.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>Thanks for the fun event! </p>
	<p>The one suggestion I have is to include trash/recycling bins further down 
	the trail from the water stations, as I was forced to either slow down or 
	stop to throw my bottle away, or toss it alongside the trail further down. </p>
	<p>As Iâ€™m getting married May 22nd of next year, I probably wonâ€™t be 
	attending the next event. However, I hope to return the following year with 
	better form and a more cooperative digestive tract </p>

	<hr>
	<p>Everything was very well done. I couldn&#39;t have asked for anything more 
	for my first&nbsp; ultramarathon of the millenium. </p>
	<p>I&#39;m not sure you had adequate medical coverage - one EMT and one aide 
	with a phone would have been appropriate, assuming they knew the 
	nonemergency phone nos. of the local emergency services and had contacted 
	the services in advance. I suspect most of us in the marathon/50km carried a 
	cellphone with Dave&#39;s phone no. programmed in (I also had Bruce&#39;s, but don&#39;t 
	know if it was his home or cellphone). That essentially made us the first 
	responders should the person in front of us have&nbsp; difficulties; I hope 
	the organizers were keeping an eye on the last group of four should anyone 
	have had to drop back from that group. I suggest for next year that we be 
	encouraged to program a separate telephone number for medical issues so the 
	meet director doesn&#39;t have to be in that loop. With a median age over 50, 
	this field is especially in need of good medical planning. </p>
	<p>On a separate matter: it never crossed my mind that some of the Gatorade 
	in the race would be low-calorie - until I opened one a ways down the trail 
	and took a sip. </p>
	<p>Once again - thanks very much for a quality event. </p>

	<hr>
	<p>Very nice event. I really enjoyed the half marathon. One comment, could 
	you start the event earlier, say, 7:30 or 8:00 a.m? The sun was a little 
	warm out there towards the end. Also, if you could have water on ice at the 
	end of the event, that would be great also. </p>
	<p>Annette LeDuc</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Bruce took a picture of my sister and me at the finish line and I 
	promised I would send it to you, so here it is. I wish I would have taken 
	pictures on the trail but I was too focused on walking...I guess. </p>
	<p>This was our first 1/2 marathon and we really didn&#39;t know what to expect, 
	but all the details were covered and we had fun. I really appreciated all 
	the information on your website as well. I&#39;ve been looking at other race 
	sites and they don&#39;t have nearly as much detail about the races and the 
	logistics of the day. </p>
	<p>At the dinner you were asking about ways to get in touch with the walking 
	community. My sister mentioned contacting community education programs. Many 
	have walking groups. I have found a web site (you may already be familiar 
	with it) <a href="http://www.marathonwalking.com">www.marathonwalking.com</a>. 
	It has a lot of good information, but I like their calendar listing walker 
	friendly marathons. Getting the We Walk Marathon added might be another way 
	to get the word out. </p>
	<p>Thanks to everyone who helped with the race!!! </p>

	<hr>
	<p>What a wonderful race. And next year will be even better. I had a e-mail 
	from a speedy Portland racewalker ( 4:30 speed range) about joining us next 
	year. We have had East Coast and South. It is time for the West Coast racers 
	to join in the fun. </p>
	<p><b>2011 Suggestions: </b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Add a â€˜New to Racewalkingâ€™ checkbox on the entry form </li>
		<li>Schedule a Racewalk Intro/ Racewalk 101 session before the Friday 
		dinner for those that are new or walkers that want to learn more. Many 
		races have a pre-race fair.. We could do a Nordic Walk, Racewalk etc 
		type of tables/sessions. </li>
		<li>Racewalk judging â€“ The point to point route is a hard one for 
		judges. There are three local colleges with track programs who could 
		maybe help us on the judging staff. Would Phil be willing to give us an 
		intro or contact the track coaches at St Johnâ€™s, St Cloud and St. 
		Benedicts? If we do the 5 km â€˜Spring Flingâ€™ race at the trail head 
		during the school session we could train the local track athletes for 
		judging, (maybe more local students would like to race too !!) </li>
		<li>Pre-race meetings; letâ€™s cover the race walk rules at the meetings 
		for those that are new and miss the Friday Intro session. Bruce , you 
		did a really nice intro at the Spring Indoor regional meet. It kept the 
		new High School athletes legal on their first race.(PRETTY GOOD!) </li>
		<li>The pre-race Marathon meeting room at the school is a really nice 
		start. I was thinking that the more numerous half marathon could do a 
		similar pre-race start at the Seven Doors church in Albany. Thereâ€™s a 
		lot better parking there as well as room for more porta-potties. I know 
		this moves back the finish line from the trail head and affects the mile 
		signs. It could make the start easier and with less impact on the 
		residential neighborhood; and it would be easy for more spectators at 
		the start. </li>
		<li>St Cloud Earth Day Walk division â€“ Phil was saying they may do a 
		formal walk division at the mid April St. Cloud Earth Day Half Marathon. 
		If this comes off then we could maybe tie into judges training in St. 
		Cloud as prep for the We Walk! in May. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>Again it was a great event this year. I hope you have fully recovered 
	from all the organizing ordeal. Best Regards </p>
