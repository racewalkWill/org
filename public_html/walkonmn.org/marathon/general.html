body  {
	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

	padding: 0;
	text-align: center; /* this centers the container in IE 5* browsers. The text is then set to the left aligned default in the #container selector */
	color: #000000;
}

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header { 
	background-color: #FFFFFF; 
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background-color: #FFFFCC; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	line-height: 30px;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #mainContent {
	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer { 
	padding: 0 10px; /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear above it. */
	background-color: #FFFFFF;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */
}

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */

        <h2>Walking </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is an event designed for walkers, wheelers, and riders.
          We welcome all walkers, including, but not limited to,
          ordinary walkers, fitness walkers, power walkers, nordic
          walkers, race walkers, hikers and even walk/runners.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are lots of marathons for runners. If you want to run a
          marathon in central Minnesota at about this time of year,
          consider the <a
            href="http://www.lakewobegontrailmarathon.org/">Lake Wobegon
            Trail Marathon</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Styles of Walking </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>When you register, you must indicate your walking style. You
          must use your selected style for the entire distance of your
          event. Here are the definitions of the walking styles
          available in this year's event:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Walking</strong> means that at least one foot appears
          to be touching the ground at all times. Strolling, hiking,
          fitness walking, power walking and ordinary walking all follow
          this rule, as do Nordic walking and race walking. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Nordic Walking</strong> means that you must walk and
          use one walking pole in each hand on every step. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="racewalk" id="racewalk"></a>Race Walking</strong>
          means that you must follow USATF rule 232.2: “[…] a
          progression of steps so taken that the [race] walker makes
          contact with the ground so that no visible (to the human eye)
          loss of contact occurs. The advancing leg must be straightened
          (i.e., not bent at the knee) from the moment of first contact
          with the ground until the leg is in the vertical upright
          position.”<br>
        </p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Wheeling</b> means you use a self-propelled non-electric
          wheel chair.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>Riding </b>means that you ride in a stroller or other
          wheeled conveyance propelled by others. A Rider must be a
          member of a team that has at least one pusher (walking style
          for pushers limited to Walking, Race Walking or Mixture of
          Walk and Running) entered in the same distance as each Rider.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="mix" id="mix"></a>Mixture of Walking and
            Running </strong> means that you walk part of the time and
          run or jog part of the time. For more information on this
          style, check out the <a href="http://www.jeffgalloway.com/">web


            site of Jeff Galloway</a>, the inventor of the Galloway
          Run-Walk-Run method. </p>

        <p><big><b><font size="+1"><big>Teams <small><small>(new 2016)</small></small></big></font></b></big><br>
          Create a team and commemorate your family group, your friends,
          or other collection of people that you talked into doing a
          marathon, half marathon or 50km with you. Each team member can
          enter the distance of their choice. Each team member is
          eligible for individual awards. A team finisher certificate is
          created for each team, giving the team name, and listing each
          finishing team members distance and time. This certificate is
          emailed to each team member. We encourage your team to take
          team pictures (before the race, at the start, during the race,
          and/or after the finish). We will include one or more of these
          pictures in the team section of the results.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Walking Judges</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We have USATF certified walking judges on the course. The
          walking judges are there to ensure that the styles of walking
          mean something, not to ask you to change how you walk. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If a walking judge sees anyone running, the judge moves them
          into the mixture of walking and running style. If a judge sees
          a Nordic walker carrying their poles instead of using them,
          the judge moves them to the walking style. If a judge sees a
          race walker violating the “straightened at the knee” rule, the
          judge moves them to the walking style. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>How slow can you go?</h2>
        <p>For the marathon and the 50km, the time limit is 9 hours -
          from the 7am start to 4pm course close. That means you have to
          maintain a pace of about 20 min/mile for the marathon or 17
          min/mile for 50km to finish in under 9 hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the half marathon, the time limit is 7.5 hours - from the
          8:30am start to the 4pm course close. That means you have to
          maintain a pace of about 34 min/mile to finish in under 7.5
          hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Water stops and Aid Stations are kept open and fully stocked
          for everyone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>How fast can you go?</h2>
        <p>We expect the first finishers to be no faster than 4:30 for
          the marathon, 1:45 for the half marathon and 5:30 for the
          50km. We use these times to plan the opening times for the
          water stops.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If your expected finish time is faster than these times,&nbsp;
          please consider the <a
            href="http://www.lakewobegontrailmarathon.org/">Lake Wobegon
            Trail Marathon</a> (held the week before) instead.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you have a Style of Walking of Walking, Race Walking or
          Nordic Walking, and are faster than these times, we will
          accommodate you by scheduling earlier opening times for the
          water stops. You have to e-mail us by May 1, asking for
          accommodation and giving your distance, expected time and
          walking style.<br>

        <h2>Emergencies</h2>
        <p><strong>Please bring your cell phone and carry it with you</strong>.
          While we don't expect any emergencies, we realize they are by
          nature, unexpected. It is good to be ready. The course is
          through rural Minnesota. Often your only companions will be
          the soft rustle of the wind and other walkers. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At race start, we will provide you with 2 cell phone numbers
          - one to contact race management and the second to contact the
          EMT service that is supporting our race. 911 is also
          available. If you are at an Aid Station, an Aid Station worker
          can make these calls for you, and can provide additional
          assistance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you have an emergency, dial 911 first. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The EMTs covering the event are there to assist you with any
          medical issues you have. If you need help dealing with
          blisters, or the sun, or whatever, please ask them for
          assistance. They may also ask you about how you are feeling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each staffed water stop has a self-help first aid kit. band
          aids, sunscreen, vaseline, and other basics are in the kit.
          Ask the staff member at the water stop if you wish first aid
          supplies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you see anything of concern along the trail, or encounter
          an issue where you need assistance, please contact a staff
          member at one of the staffed water stops, or contact the race
          director, or contact the EMT, or in the event of an emergency,
          call 911.</p>

        <h2>The Weather </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>The weather in Minnesota is quite variable in May. It could
          be 30 degrees and windy, or 70 degrees and sunny. One year we
          had 3" of rain at the finish line during the race. Another
          year was 60 degrees with a wonderful tailwind. Be sure to <a
href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/hdfForecast?query=56374&amp;searchType=WEATHER">check


            the predicted weather for St Joseph, MN 56374</a> before you
          decide what to wear on race day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The event is never postponed because of weather to another
          day. The start can be delayed if a line of severe storms comes
          thru. Each participant should make themselves aware of the
          predicted weather for the day and make appropriate decisions
          about what to do. You will be walking thru rural Minnesota,
          with sturdy shelter often a significant distance away. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can switch from a longer distance to a shorter distance
          on race day if you are concerned about the weather (or for any
          other reason). We do not offer refunds for changing to a
          shorter distance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the weather is sufficiently bad in the morning, we may
          cancel one or more of the distances. We do not offer refunds
          in the event that we must cancel your distance because of
          weather. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We are very open about the decision making process regarding
          weather. If you see something of concern, please bring it to
          our attention. A lot of weather information is available to
          every smart phone user these days. We encourage you to take
          advantage of this information prior to the start, and during
          the event. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Health Warnings</h2>
        <p>The sun in mid-May is the same strength as the sun in late
          July. Your skin is probably not used to long exposure to the
          sun (especially if you are just coming out of a long Minnesota
          winter). We recommend sun block.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Even if it seems cold, remember to drink an appropriate
          amount of fluids for your body and level of effort. We have
          water stops every couple of miles that offer water and sports
          drink and something simple to eat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Check for ticks after the race.</strong> If you stay
          on the asphalt path, you probably won't get any. Ticks with
          Lyme disease are in Minnesota, so you can't be too careful.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>The Start </h2>

        <p>We encourage all participants to take the bus to the start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Directions to the start for spectators and support crews are
          <a href="directions.html">here</a>. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Saturday Morning Coffee</h2>
        <p>For the marathon, coffee, bagels, juice and fruit will be at
          the starting line at St Mary's School. For the half marathon,
          coffee and bagels will be available at the trailhead building
          starting at 6am.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>The Course</h2>
        <p>All events are held on the Lake Wobegon® Regional Trail. <a
            href="course.htm">More detail</a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>The Finish </h2>
        <p>The finish is at mile marker 82 on the Lake Wobegon Regional
          Trail, on the north edge of St Joseph. There will be post race
          goodies in the <a href="#trailhead">Lake Wobegon Trailhead in
            St Joseph</a>, just a 100 meters down the trail from the
          finish. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Awards </h2>
        <p>Every finisher will receiver a We Walk! Marathon
          commemorative medal at the finish.</p>
        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>Bib Numbers</h2>
        <p><strong>Bib numbers should be placed on the front of the
            chest.</strong> This helps our water stop workers identify
          you as a part of the event, makes it possible for our
          photographers to identify you in the pictures, and makes it
          easier for our finish line crew to get the timing and the
          awards done quickly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We provide each walker with 4 identically numbered bib
          numbers. We do this because we want you to put a bib number on
          each layer that you wear. That way, when you get warm and take
          a layer off, there is still a bib number visible. And, when
          you want to drop of <a href="#excess">excess clothing</a>,
          there is a good chance that one of the pieces will have a bib
          number attached to it, making the drop off quick and simple,
          and the recovery of clothes at the finish easy because you can
          easily see your bib number thru the clear plastic bag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you have fewer than 4 layers, please place the remaining
          bib numbers on the back of the layers you think are most
          likely to be on the outside during the last part of the event.
          This is in addition to the bib number that is already on the
          front.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you have a water proof jacket, or other good jacket that
          you don't want to pierce with pins, you don't need to attach a
          bib number to it. But, please wear you bib number on the layer
          beneath the jacket and be prepared to "flash" your bib number
          at the finish line. Put a bib number for the water proof layer
          or good jacket in a pocket so that if you check it as <a
            href="#excess">excess clothing</a>, you have a bib number to
          identify it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><a name="excess" id="excess"></a>Excess Clothing</h2>
        <p>We provide clear plastic bags at the start line, and at the
          first staffed water stop you encounter, to hold any clothes
          that you no longer need. For the marathon and 50km, you may
          also drop clothes off at the second staffed water stop. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Simply get a clear plastic bag from the Aid Station
          volunteer, place your excess clothes inside, making one of
          your bib numbers visible thru the bag, tie it shut and give it
          back to the Aid Station volunteer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is why we give you 4 identical bib numbers. Since "tops"
          are the most likely piece of clothing to remove, having a bib
          number already on the front of each layer makes this process
          quick and simple. Your bib number will identify the owner of
          the bag, and will be easily visible thru the clear plastic
          bag. We plan to have each bag at <a href="#trailhead">Lake
            Wobegon Trailhead in St Joseph</a> at the finish line before
          you cross the finish line.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Spectators </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There are several good opportunities for spectators to
          interact with participants along the <a href="course.htm">course</a>.
          The prime locations are in each of the towns: Melrose,
          Freeport, Albany, Avon, and St Joseph. The Lake Wobegon Trail
          is on an old railroad track, which is on most road maps. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The start of the half marathon is adjacent to a residential
          neighborhood. Take special care to be considerate of the
          residents if you come to the half marathon start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We ask that spectators use extreme caution if they select a
          rural location to watch. Off-street parking is not available
          along the country roads, and road shoulders are narrow or
          non-existent. This is especially true at Collegeville. It may
          look like a town on the map, but it is not even a wide spot in
          the road.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Airports </h2>
        <p>The closest airport is in St Cloud, MN (airport code STC).
          There are few flights per day into STC, and the planes are
          small, so book early. STC is about 15 miles (30 minutes) away
          from St Joseph (<a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=st+joseph,+mn&amp;daddr=STC&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=45.243143,-93.707406&amp;sspn=1.823581,1.741333&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11">map</a>).


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nearby major airport is in Minneapolis / St. Paul
          (airport code MSP). MSP is a major hub. MSP is 86 miles from
          St Joseph (<a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=st+joseph,+mn&amp;daddr=MSP&amp;geocode=FSVEtwIdCNFg-ikTSO7Ez1m0UjEEjESIFJJ-SQ;&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=45.55381,-94.193265&amp;sspn=0.453406,0.435333&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=9">map</a>).


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Local Transportation &amp; Rental Cars </h2>
        <p>St. Joseph is in rural Minnesota with almost non-existent
          public transportation. You will most likely need to have
          access to a car. Rental cars are available at the airports
          (STC and MSP). </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><a name="EventHotel" id="EventHotel"></a>Lodging </h2>
        <p>St Joseph
          <!-- end #mainContent --> is a small town, with very limited
          commercial lodging. St Cloud is a larger town nearby with more
          housing alternatives.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        An event hotel/lodging will be announced in early 2016.<br>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are several other motels nearby. </p>
        <p>One way to find them is to <a
