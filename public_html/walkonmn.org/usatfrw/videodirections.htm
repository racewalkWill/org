<h2>Directions for Creating the Video</h2>
<p>for the video coaching program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best video is captured under race conditions, but sometimes this is not 
practical. A reasonable</p>
<p>substitute is to video a workout that mimics race length and speed as closely 
as possible. An indoor or outdoor track is a good place to capture video because 
the lap size is relatively small, providing many opportunities to video an 
athlete within a single workout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to video at the appropriate stage in the race/workout.&nbsp; Early 
stages may capture warm-up issues. Middle stages may capture the best form. Late 
stages may capture fatigue issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are videoing during a race, or on a track with other athletes, be 
careful to not interfere with the other athletes. Creating the video is 
important, but your athlete will come around again on the next lap, so any one 
opportunity is not that significant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capture video in a straight part of the course, not at a corner, unless the 
athlete has a particular issue with corners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 4 views.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Front View</b></p>
<p>The front view of the athlete is captured by stepping onto the course when 
the athlete is a long way away and videoing until the athlete more than fills 
the frame of the video camera, then stepping off the course before the athlete 
walks over you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Back View</b></p>
<p>The back view of the athlete is captured by stepping onto the course 
immediately after the athlete goes by and videoing until the athlete is very 
small in the frame. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Right Side View</b></p>
<p>The right side view of the athlete is captured by standing on the right side 
(as viewed by the athlete) of the course, at least 15 feet away from the path 
the athlete will follow. Select a zoom setting so the athlete &quot;fills the frame&quot; 
when they walk by. If the athlete more than fills the frame at the lowest zoom 
level, then back away from the path. It is best to find the spot to stand before 
you are under pressure of videoing the athlete. Start videoing as the athlete 
approaches, as the athlete passes, and for just a little bit as the athlete goes 
away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Left Side View</b></p>
<p>The left side view of the athlete is captured by standing on the left side 
(as viewed by the athlete) of the course, but otherwise exactly like the right 
side view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Technique Coaching</b></p>
<p>These directions are for creating the standard video for technique coaching. 
If you have an ongoing relationship with a technique coach, the coach may 
request something different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a video with each view in each stage of the race/workout (early, 
middle, late). If possible, capture a couple more side views in each stage. If 
you are skilled enough to zoom while videoing, make the athlete &quot;fills the 
frame&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Judging</b></p>
<p>Create a video with 2 right side views and 2 left side views in each stage of 
the race/workout (early, middle, late). Start videoing each view when the walker 
is quite far away. Do not adjust the zoom.</p>
