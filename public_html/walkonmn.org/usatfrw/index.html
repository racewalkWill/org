<h2>Video Coaching &amp; Video Judging</h2>
<p>USATF Racewalking Program from Walk On! Minnesota</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of this program is to upgrade the coaching available to 
racewalkers in the USA. Technique coaching can be done by video analysis, even 
if the technique coach and the athlete are no in the same geographic location. 
Similarly, judging can determine if a walker's technique is legal or not, and if 
not, what is wrong. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How the Program Works</h3>
<p>An athlete follows a few simple steps to register with the program, install 
the video analysis software, and <a href="videodirections.htm">create the video</a>. 
The athlete then <a href="coaches+judges.htm">selects a video coach/judge</a>, 
purchases a video coaching/judging session and uploads the video. The 
coach/judge downloads the video and returns feedback to the athlete.</p>
