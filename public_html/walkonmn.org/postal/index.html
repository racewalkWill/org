/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFCC;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header { 
	background-color: #FFFFCC; 
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background-color: #FFFF99; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	line-height: 30px;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #mainContent {
	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer { 
	padding: 0 10px; /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear above it. */
	background-color: #FFFF99;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */
}

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;

    <h1>The Postal</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="http://walkonmn.org">Walk On! Minnesota</a> is pleased to offer the 2010 edition of the One-Hour Postal Race Walk and to announce the 
	<a href="results2009.htm">final results for the 2009 edition</a>. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Ordering Awards &amp; T-Shirts for 2009 Results</h3>
    <p>I am a little behind in working with the designer for the t-shirts and in 
	getting the website setup to take orders, and in getting the certificates on 
	the website. My goal is to have all of that working by March 15. My 
	apologies to those that were counting on the date that was announced on this 
	website earlier. Hopefully you will like the logo chosen for the 2009 
	postal:</p>

    <h3>What is a Postal anyway?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A postal is a way of combining the results of races that occur at different times and different places. The race organizer, or a race participant, mails  the results to a common place, the results are validated, and then merged with all of the other results. Because the Post Office was used to mail in the resuls on paper in the early versions of this event, it became known as a <strong>postal</strong>. Today, we use e-mail or the web to report most of the results, but we still keep the name. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Why is a Postal interesting?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There just aren't many race walkers around. You are lucky if you have more than one or two people in your age/gender group in any local race. A postal event allows you to compete against others, even if you never toe the starting line in a race with them. You get a chance to see how you are doing in a much larger group of race walkers. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are discouraged because you think you are slow, or because you don't have enough time to practice, you'll find that others in your age group have the same problem. If you are working really hard, you can see how well you are doing against the best . </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As the year progresses, you can look at the current version of the results and see how you are doing. At year end, after the final set of race results are merged, you can see the final results.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>What are the Postal events this year?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In race walking, the primary postal event is the one-hour race. Simply put, how far can you race walk in one hour? It is an unusual event, as most track, long distance running and race walking events cover a fixed distance and the challenge is to see how fast you can do it. In the one-hour, the time you have to cover  distance is fixed at 60 minutes, and the amount of distance that you can cover in that time is the challenge.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We  also offer a half-hour postal. This event is primarily targeted at young walkers and new walkers, where an hour of exertion is inappropriate for their skill level or their level of physical training.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Who can enter?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anyone can enter. We accept results from any state and from any country. All you have to do is to follow the <a href="rules.html">rules for submitting results</a>. While we accept results from athletes, we prefer results from race directors or from their designated representative. The event itself must be documented, as well as the result for an athlete, and getting one collection of information for all of the athletes in a race makes our job a lot easier.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>How are the results displayed?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As results are submitted, we add them to the partial results. When the date passes to submit additional results, the partial results are finalized. You can view the partial results during the year, or the final results when they are created, in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>for any country
        <ul>
          <li> by age/gender group</li>
          <li> by gender</li>
          <li>overall</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>for all entries
        <ul>
          <li>by age/gender group</li>
          <li> by gender</li>
          <li>overall</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>When are the final results posted?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The final results for each year become a permanent part of this web site. You will always be able to see your result. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <a href="results2009.htm">final results for 2009</a> were posted on February 15, 2010. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our goal is to post the final results for 2010 by January 15, 2011.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>What are the awards?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We will have an award certificate available on this web site for all participants. It will show your event, the total distance achieved, and your ranking (overall, gender, age/gender group) within your country and within all entries. You will be able to download and print this award certificate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A commemorative<strong> </strong>t-shirt may be purchased from this website starting in late 
	March. Shirts will be available in children's, women's, and men's cuts, with US sizing. Anyone may purchase these t-shirts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you placed in the Top-3 of one of the standard ways of displaying the final results, you may purchase a 
	medal from this website. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is no charge to enter the one-hour postal or the half-hour postal..</p>
