/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFCC;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header { 
	background-color: #FFFFCC; 
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background-color: #FFFF99; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	line-height: 30px;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #mainContent {
	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer { 
	padding: 0 10px; /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear above it. */
	background-color: #FFFF99;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */
}

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;

    <h1> The Rules</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> Events</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are two events in the  postal: one-hour and half-hour. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The one-hour postal has a time period of 60 minutes. while the half-hour postal has a time period of 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The distance covered by an athlete within the time period is the result for that event.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Acceptable Events</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An acceptable event must</p>
    <ul>
      <li>occur during the current calendar year</li>
      <li>follow USATF or IAAF rules for a race walk event</li>
      <li>be one of these types of events
        <ul>
          <li>a one-hour event, or</li>
          <li>a half-hour event, or </li>
          <li>an en route event (where the time period occurs before the completion of the primary event), or</li>
          <li>a continuation event (where the time period occurs after the completion of the primary event and the athletes are allowed to continue walking)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Example en route event: a 10km event could provide half-hour postal results for everyone, and one-hour postal results for those that took longer than an hour to do 10km.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Example continuation event: a 10km event could provide one-hour postal results for those that completed the 10km in under an hour by allowing those athletes to continue walking until the hour was up.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Acceptable Courses</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A surveyed indoor or outdoor track</strong> is an acceptable course. Most junior high, high school, college, and university tracks in the US meet this criteria. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A certified road course </strong>is an acceptable course. Each member association of IAAF has an established procedure for certifying road courses. For USATF, the procedure for certifying a road course is defined <a href="http://www.usatf.org/events/courses/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A combination of acceptable courses</strong> is an acceptable course. We use a certified 1km course and a certified 100m course. The athletes walk the 1km course until the time remaining is not enough for them to complete the 1km course, then they switch to the 100m course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A non-surveyed track</strong>, such as the one at a fitness center,  can become acceptable by certifying it as if it was a road course. You should obtain permission from the owner of the track before attempting to certify it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>No other courses</strong> are acceptable.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A course measured with a measuring wheel, a bicycle odometer, or a car odometer is not an acceptable course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Acceptable Level of Judging</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At least three certified race walk judges are required. These judges may be  certified by the IAAF or by any national governing body for race walking.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Counting Whole Laps</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A whole lap is a lap that was begun during the time period and was completed during the time period.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some method must be used to record split times or lap times for each lap. This can be some form of transponder timing or hand timing or lap counting. For lap counting, it is not enough to record the lap, but something must be recorded to allow the computation of the split time. When <a href="submit.html">submitting results</a>, you must include the split time for each lap for each athlete.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Counting Partial Laps</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A partial lap is a lap that was begun during the time period, but was not completed by the end of the time period.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is not necessary to count partial laps.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To count partial laps, you must have some method  to communicate the end of the time period to the athletes and/or to race officials. For tracks, this is usually accomplished with a noise making device (for example: a starter's pistol, a megaphone, an air horn). For longer courses this can be a significant challenge. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To count partial laps you must some method of determining where an athlete was at the end of the time period. One method is to have the athlete carry some unique item (we use a plastic bag with their bib number on it and a small amount of sand in it). When the time period expires, the athlete drops the bag. Other methods are acceptable. Document your method in the race documentation file.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To count partial laps, you must have some method to measure the distance from the start of the lap to where each athlete was. One method is to use a measuring wheel. Since measuring wheels can be quite inaccurate, first measure one lap with the wheel. Create the wheel accuracy ratio by taking the surveyed/certified distance of the lap and dividing by the measured distance with the wheel. Then, from the beginning of each lap, use the wheel to measure  the distance to where the athlete was. Multiply the measured partial lap distance by the wheel accuracy ratio to get the actual partial lap distance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Computing Distance</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Compute the lap times and make sure that they are reasonable. If one lap time is about twice as long as the others, than the lap counter may have missed a lap, or the athlete may have gone to the bathroom. The goal is to get the correct number of complete laps.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you decide not to use partial laps, the distance is the correct number of laps completed multiplied by the distance of one lap.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you decide to use partial laps, you also add in the actual partial lap distance after computing the distance traveled in complete laps.</p>
