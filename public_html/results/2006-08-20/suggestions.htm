<h2>Suggestions / Complaints</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>The DQ &amp; Lap Counter Boards </b>- placed too far from the 
			finish, placed where spectators and volunteers stood in front of 
			them, were too hard to read, the lap counter marks did not help, had 
			a hard time finding my number, etc.. Separate the DQ &amp; Lap counter 
			boards. The DQ board should only have bib numbers that have red 
			cards.</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Response </b>- we will entirely rework the DQ &amp; Lap Counting 
			situation for next year.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<ol start="2">
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Why didn't you use the Sheraton Hotel next to the course?</b>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Response</b> - it opened after people had started reserving 
			rooms at our event hotel. We'll probably use it next year.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol start="3">
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Awards: </b></li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Why couldn't you announce any of the age-group records? </b>
			</p>
			<p><b>I thought the awards for the USA 15km would be 6 deep not 3 
			deep.</b></p>
			<p><b>How come you didn't announce the age-group records?</b></p>
			<p><b>Response</b> - We got &quot;dazed&quot; when we got the results, and 
			forgot to check against the list of records that we had at the race. 
			We will build a check list of things to do with the results before 
			announcing. It will catch this and any mal-functioning or missing 
			ChampionChips. Awards that we forgot to hand out will be mailed. I 
			apologize for not announcing them at the event and letting you hear 
			the response of your peers.</p>

		<ol start="4">
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>The lemonade at dinner was STRONG.</b></li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Response</b> - we'll have someone besides Bruce blend the 
			lemonade next year. He actually likes the stuff that strong, and is 
			still drinking the leftovers.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol start="5">
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>The Turnarounds: </b></li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>The paved surface at the outside of the 
			turns was very narrow </b></p>
			<p><b>There was gravel on the outside of the turn. </b></p>
			<p><b>The turns were very 
			sharp.</b></p>
			<p><b>Just relax with the tight turn, put a single cone out there.</b></p>
			<p><b>Response</b> - we will look for a carpet covering that we can 
			&quot;nail&quot; down to remove the hazard of the gravel. If we use a large 
			enough piece, and &quot;nail&quot; the edge next to the path down well enough, 
			we should be able to remove the hazard of the gravel without adding 
			a trip hazard with the edge of the carpet. Not much we can do about 
			the sharpness of the corners - as the 1.9m radius is the biggest 
			that will fit, given the constraints the park district has placed on 
			us. The single cone idea would work fine for an event that did not 
			have very many people approaching the turnaround at once. Athletes 
			could pick their line through the turnaround without worrying too 
			much about what anyone else was doing. With the crowds we had 
			approaching the turnaround during the early part of the race, it 
			seems more reasonable to control things a little more. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol start="6">
			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Can you get the judges 
			to move away from the turnarounds?</b></p></li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Response -</b> we recognize that the 180 degree turn is, at 
			best, a hard part of the course for a high-speed walker (check out 
			the lean in the pictures), and at worst, a flaw in the course. We 
			are looking for a venue that would allow a course with 4, equally 
			spaced, 90 degree corners, but have not found one yet. The Chief 
			Race Walk Judge decides where to place the judges, and gives 
			instructions on what they should concentrate on. As a judge, I've 
			been asked to pay special attention to water stops, feeding zones, 
			port-a-potties, downhills and turnarounds. As athletes, you have to 
			adapt to what the judges are paying attention to. If they don't 
			watch the turnarounds, some will start running them. This way, 
			everyone knew the judges were hovering at the turnarounds, so people 
			were more careful. Two master's level judges worked the turnarounds 
			this year, so we had our most experienced judges handling this 
			difficult part of the course.</p>

			<li>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>How about a post-race 
			meal &amp; awards ceremony?</b></p></li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>Response</b> - an interesting suggestion. With next year's 
			event hotel being adjacent to the course, it would be reasonable to 
			schedule a 10:30am brunch with the awards in the event hotel, and 
			that would give time to get a shower, break down the course, and 
			validate results before brunch, and still not go too late into the 
			day for plane flights home. We'll consider it! </p>
