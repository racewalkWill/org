<h1>Jorvig Park Race Walk Course</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>The <b>Jorvig Park Race Walk Course</b> is on Rails-to-Trails park featuring 12 foot wide asphalt path that is straight, 
flat, not significantly crowned, and pothole free. This lightly used pathway has no automobile or truck traffic and no 
road crossings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course hast 3 measured out-and-back loops that share one common turn: 
1.25km, 2.5km and 5km. All 3 courses are USATF certified to ensure you of accurate distances. This layout allows us to offer a wide variety of 
distances on each race day, allows all of the walkers to see each other during 
the race and simplifies race management.</p>

<h2>Course Measurement Process</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course was surveyed on 23 April 2005 by Dave Daubert and Bruce Leasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to end up with 3 loops of 1.25km, 2.5km and 5km.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Race walks are traditionally held on out-and-back courses, so we only need 
half of the required distances. This means we are looking at 625m, 1250m and 
2500m in one direction of the out-and-back..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apply the 1.001 fudge factor to each of the distances to ensure that each 
course is long enough. After applying the fudge factor, we are looking at 
625.625, 1251.25 and 2502.5m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this course is designed for race walking, we turn each out-and-back 
course into a loop by replacing the common starting point for all of the courses 
with a common turnaround. Each turnaround is a 1 meter radius semi-circle. The 
semi-circle is 3.14159 meters of path. We subtract 1 semi-circles worth of path 
from each distance, yielding 622.48341m, 1248.10841m and 2499.35841m for the 
distances between the center points of the turnarounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this course is straight, flat, and only 2.5km long, we measure the 
course with a surveyor's wheel that is accurate to 0.01m. We round up the 
distances to be measured to the next 0.01. This yields 622.49m, 1248.11m and 
2499.36m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Measurement 1 - East to West</b></p>
<p>We mark the center of the common turnaround with an orange flag, zero the 
distance on the wheel, align the wheel with the flag and begin measuring to the 
west. When the path wiggles slightly at bridges (we will encounter 2 of them), 
we measure straight thru, as if the bridge did not exist. When we reach 622.49m 
we mark the center of the 1.25km turnaround with an orange flag. We continue 
measuring to the west. When we reach 1248.11m, we mark the center of the 2.5km 
turnaround with an orange flag. We continue measuring to the west. When we reach 
2499.36m, we mark the center of the 5km turnaround with an orange flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Measurement 2 - West to East</b></p>
<p>We zero the distance on the wheel, align the wheel with the flag at the 
center of the 5km turnaround and begin measuring to the east.</p>
<p>When we reach 1251.25 we place a yellow flag for the center of the 2.5km 
turnaround. It exactly matches the orange flag. We continue measuring to the 
east. When we reach 1876.87m we place a yellow flag for the center of the 1.25km 
turnaround. The yellow flag is about 5&quot; west of the orange flag. We continue 
measuring to the east. When we reach 2499.36m we place a yellow flag for the 
center of the common turnaround. The yellow flag is 1 foot to the west of the 
orange flag marking the center of the common turnaround. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use the orange flag location for the center of the common turnaround. We 
use the yellow flag location for the center of the 1.25km turnaround as it is 
further west. We use the orange flag locations for each of the other 
turnarounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Marking the Course</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We place a PK nail with 1½ inch washer around it at the center of each 
turnaround. Additionally, we marked this PK nail with pink paint. To enable easy 
placement of the 1m radius semi-circle of cones needed at each turnaround, we 
place an additional PK nail without washer 1m away on the side where the cones 
should be placed.&nbsp; Both PK nails are placed in the center of the path, 
where the dashed yellow paint line is. See the <a href="#CertificationMap">
certification course map</a> for aids in locating the PK nails.</p>
