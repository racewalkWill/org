<h1>2007 Run with the Celts 5km</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USATF Certified Course MN-07030-RR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course starts on Lilydale Rd (sometimes called Water St) underneath the 
center of the Smith Avenue high bridge. The course proceeds south west, on the 
street to Lilydale Regional Park. The course continues south west long the road, but is restricted to the left 
hand lane of the road. The 1 km mark is directly underneath the high utility 
lines that cross the river. The course continues in the left hand lane all the way to the 2 km mark. The 
2 km mark is past the wooden trestle at the driveway of the large parking lot on 
the left separating the road and a pond. This is the turnaround. At the turnaround, the course doubles back on itself, staying in the left 
hand lane to the 3 km mark, which is directly across the road from the 1 km mark. The course continues north east in the left hand lane of the street until 
entering a bicycle/walk/run path that is closer to the river than the road at 
Lilydale Regional Park. The course continues north east on the bicycle/walk/run 
path. The 4 km mark is underneath the Smith Avenue high bridge, adjacent to the 
start. The course continues on the bicycle/walk/run path, past the yacht club up to 
Plato Boulevard. The course then turns left, down the sidewalk toward the river, 
crossing the parking lot entrance. After passing the sidewalk at the far end of 
the traffic circle, the course takes the next sidewalk to the north east, which 
merges into the sidewalk along the river. The course ends on the river sidewalk 
at the flag pole in the center of Harriet Island Park.</p>

<h3>Required Cones</h3>
<ul>
	<li>from where the bicycle/walk/run path joins Lilydale Rd. at Lilydale 
	Regional Park, down the center of the road, all the way to the turnaround - 
	about 1.1km</li>
	<li>on the PK nail that marks the turnaround</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommended Cones</h3>
<ul>
	<li>across Lilydale Rd, just south east of the yacht club parking lot 
	entrance - to close the Lilydale Rd to the south east (this is just before 
	the start)</li>
	<li>across the entrance to Lilydale Regional Park</li>
	<li>across Lilydale Rod, just south east of the turnaround - to close 
	Lilydale Rd</li>
	<li>at the yacht club entrance near the start - to keep people parking at 
	the yacht club lot from crossing the course</li>
	<li>across each harbor access sidewalk from the 4km split to Plato Boulevard 
	- to make pedestrians aware that something is going on</li>
	<li>at the branch in the bicycle/walk/run path between the yacht club 
	parking lot entrance and Plato Boulevard - to encourage runners to take the 
	shorter left hand path.</li>
	<li>at the entrance to the parking lot just prior to mile 4 - to keep 
	vehicle traffic from crossing the course</li>
	<li>at the 90 degree turn just before the 3 mile mark - to keep 
	runners/walkers on the course</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recommended Water Stop Location</h3>
<p>Just after the course enters the bicycle/walk/run path and before the 2 mile 
mark. There is a wide spot in the bicycle/walk/run path and there is convenient 
parking for volunteers in the driveway to Lilydale Regional Park.</p>
