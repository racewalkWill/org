</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Required Cones</h3>
<ul>
	<li>From the finish line south on W River Pkwy, Godfrey Ave and Minnehaha 
	Ave, cones must be placed on the road centerline (2-way traffic). Marathon 
	and Half Marathon runners go in the same direction as car traffic. 
	Exceptions<ul>
	<li>at the finish line, the first time runners go by (on the way north), 
	they have full use of the road from 11th Ave S to the finish line. By the 
	time they come back going south, the road must be coned down the middle, 
	starting just to the north of the finish line (to get them to merge over 
	into the west half of the road) then down the centerline to11th Ave S. All 
	other cones on W River Pkwy can be placed prior to race start. </li>
	<li>at the roundabout at Godfrey Ave and Minnehaha Ave, cone so the runners 
	going in both directions use the single lane on the SE part of the 
	roundabout (runners going out will be running against the traffic flow for 
	vehicles). Cone this single lane in half to accomplish this.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>across W River Pkwy at E 32nd St to ensure runners make the turn (and 
	don't keep going south on W River Pkwy)</li>
	<li>the bike path from Minnehaha&nbsp; (near Hiawatha), and along the 
	parking lot, must be coned down the middle (2-way traffic), all the way to 
	where the path Ys.</li>
	<li>the bike path at the foot of the steep hill in Fort Snelling Park must 
	be coned down the middle (2-way traffic).</li>
	<li>the asphalt road in Fort Snelling Park that goes under 55 must be coned 
	on the north side. The eastern part has 2 running lanes (2-way traffic) and 
	the rest (from 55 to the north end of Lake Snelling) has one running lane. 
	Use 4' lane widths.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recommended Cones</h3>
<ul>
	<li>at the parking lot at the end of the Stone Arch Bridge - to make sure 
	runners take the turn</li>
	<li>at all bike path entrances/exits - to encourage runners to not trip over 
	the raised curbs at the edges of the bike paths</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recommended Starting Procedure when both courses are used</h3>
<ul>
	<li>cone S 2nd St down the middle to create two lanes, from before the half 
	marathon start to about 800 S 2nd St.</li>
	<li>Have the half marathon start in the west lane at their starting line and 
	the marathon start in the east lane at their starting line. </li>
	<li>Everyone is restricted by the cones to stay in their lane until about 
	800 S 2nd St. Then let them merge. </li>
	<li>Use either marathon or half marathon mile markers up to the half 
	marathon turnaround (the difference is small, and only noticeable at mile 1 
	and at the first mile marker after the half marathon turnaround.</li>
</ul>
