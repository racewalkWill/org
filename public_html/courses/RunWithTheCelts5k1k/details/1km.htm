<p><b><font size="4">All along Water St. W</font></b></p>
<p><b>Cones</b>: place cones in or around all pot holes. You may not see them 
all from a vehicle - it is recommended that a runner or biker check the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">1 km split</font></b></p>
<p><b>Approximate Location</b>: on Water St W, between 10th and 11th utility poles 
further away from the starting line than the high bridge carrying Smith Ave 
crosses high over Water St W. The road veers gently to the left. A wide gravel 
opening allows access to the bike trail on the right.</p>
<p><b>Location</b>: a washered-PK nail in Water St W, about 1 foot from the left 
(south) edge of the road. </p>
<p><b>Signage</b>: place the 1 km split sign on the right (north) side of the 
road, as the shortest path for the runners is on the left side of the road.</p>
