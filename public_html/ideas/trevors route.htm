<p>My wife has been a devotee of this group for about six months, giving it her 
rapt attention when she should have been giving attention to me. I have been an 
occasional reader, thinking of submitting a whimsical post occasionally, but 
deciding to wait until my son could bestow greater credibility upon my 
reflections. I guess that time has arrived. </p>
<p>Three turning points have marked Trevor's life as a racewalker. First, how he 
began racewalking at age 9 (as Tom Eastler has accurately calculated): as Trevor 
has recounted in recent interviews, his sister entered track and field after 
discovering that she was a good jumper and he tagged along. In 2001 she earned 
an expenses-paid-by-Dad trip to the Junior Olympics in Sacramento, including her 
first plane flight, and Trevor, having placed consistently near the back in the 
sprints and long jump, stayed home. Trevor resolved that next year he would be 
on the plane. As a result he tried every event available to a bantam and ended 
up qualifying for the 2002 Omaha Junior Olympics in three events. There he 
placed 27th in both the turbo-javelin and high jump, but second in the racewalk. 
He was inspired. John MacLachlan and Ray Kuhles were starting their Racewalking 
International youth training program that year and, failing to notice that the 
brochure said they wanted kids age 12 and over, signed him up. </p>
<p>Second, what made him begin to train more seriously: during his years with 
Ray Kuhles Trevor learned a lot but didn't practice much, because he was a 
dedicated and high-performing swimmer. He won Junior Olympic titles in 2003-2005 
anyhow. In fall 2005 his epileptic seizures became sufficiently frequent and 
problematic that he was kicked out of his swim club. As small compensation 
during this despondent period, we gave him, as a 2005 Christmas present, a free 
trip to south Texas. He went there in March 2006, living with the Vergara family 
for a week and experiencing rigorous racewalk training for the first time. 
Trevor had successful brain surgery in August 2006 but never returned to serious 
swimming. </p>
<p>Third, what reversed Trevor's decision to quit racewalking: Trevor was so 
sensitive to the teasing he received while training in a park near our home that 
he resolved to become a runner once he returned from the 2008 World Race Walking 
Cup in Russia. He refused to go to Junior Nationals even though it was just 
three hours away and instead ran through the summer and then through a 
distinctly subpar cross-country season. Angry about his performance in the local 
cross-country championships, he committed himself to a brutal running schedule 
for two more weeks, after which he decided that the training plan was 
unsustainable and the goal of being a great runner was probably unachievable. At 
that point he returned to racewalking. </p>
<p>Several important observations arise from these highlights. First, because 
racewalking is so far down the food chain of U.S. athletic activities, great 
swimmers don't racewalk and great runners don't racewalk. We tend to get only 
the middle-of-the-barrel athlete who may be good but not stupendous in other 
disciplines. This is not an ideal situation, but since we will not change the 
culture overnight we need to accept it and present racewalking as an exciting, 
demanding, but rewarding discipline as broadly as possible. Since incorporation 
of racewalking into high school and NCAA programs is not around the corner, 
perhaps highlighting our sport's international popularity may help. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Three Rivers Association of USA Track and Field made 
Trevor's success possible. In the nine years of our involvement with this 
association, every single local or association championship meet—-about 60 in 
all-—has included a racewalk. One meet each year drops the 400 meters to save 
time, but no meet ever drops the racewalk. (Once when a meet was running late 
the announcer proposed canceling the racewalk, but I stormed the field and 
prevented this deletion.) As a result Trevor saw a few kids who could racewalk 
and a few coaches who knew how to teach it. Without this initial opportunity, 
none of his other steps forward in the ensuing seven years could ever have 
happened. </p>
<p>One more significant observation can be readily deduced from Trevor's story: 
it is hard for a teenager to train as a racewalker. Combine few coaches, few 
training partners, few scholarships, and no recognition (except for the 
teasing), and then consider the amount of time needed to develop the endurance 
to succeed at the 10-kilometer distance, and it's not surprising that we have 
such a small cohort of high schoolers pursuing this discipline. Moreover, it is 
hard to imagine that Trevor could have enjoyed such a successful 2009 season if 
he had spent the winter in Pittsburgh, with its difficult weather, total absence 
of serious racewalkers, and lack of indoor training facility. His success 
required parents willing to remove Trevor from the middle of his junior year of 
high school, send him to sunny San Diego for four months, and tolerate his 
temporary decline into academic mediocrity. (Trevor, generally an excellent 
student, has agreed to delay his progress into college by at least a year.) </p>
<p>We may have a relatively small racewalking community, but many people who 
have made significant contributions to Trevor's growth can claim a share of the 
credit for his recent successes. A few are worth naming-—apologies in advance to 
any I omit. I have already mentioned John MacLachlan, Ray Kuhles, and the 
Vergaras. Debbie Williams of the South Park Track Club taught Trevor to racewalk 
when no one in our own club could do so. The Nemeths and Labashes were two 
racewalk-knowledgeable and encouraging families in our association. A.C. Jaime 
welcomed Trevor to Texas several times and offered great encouragement. David 
Lawrence and Allen James gave Trevor the chance to train and race with them in 
the Buffalo area. Vince Peters has offered invaluable support in many ways, 
including a ride to the 2008 indoor meets. Zachary Pollinger was Trevor's first 
racewalking mentor and Bill Pollinger has offered untiring encouragement and 
counsel, even when awarding Trevor those dreaded red cards. Mike Rohl and Mike 
Dewitt have provided suggestions at crucial moments. Others have participated in 
the racewalk training camps. John Nunn gave Trevor a place to live in San Diego 
and of course Tim Seaman has given high-quality, low-cost coaching to a 
sometimes high-strung, low-communication teenager. </p>
<p>Those who wonder about USATF's support of racewalkers may find our experience 
encouraging. Trevor has been funded for three international trips in the last 15 
months, with a fourth (to Trinidad for Pan Am Juniors) ahead. That doesn't even 
count USA vs. Canada, in which he did not compete. He was also funded (along 
with the Sorensons) for two weeks of training in California with Tim Seaman 
immediately prior to Junior Nationals. I have had three conversations with 
national youth chair Lionel Leach in the last month, two by phone and one today 
in person at the Region 2 Junior Olympics in Jamestown, NY. (That's right, my 
family went to Italy and I went to Jamestown. Happily, I got to watch a 
9-year-old girl from our youth club complete a beautiful 1500-meter racewalk and 
position herself as a serious candidate for a national Junior Olympic 
championship. We're doing our part to build the racewalking pipeline, though 
even in our youth club nobody who can do any other event well bothers with the 
racewalk.) Lionel has expressed strong support for investment in upgrading the 
quality of youth racewalking, and I have offered our assistance in any way 
possible. </p>
<p>Except that it is harder for me to be Trevor's training partner, now that he 
has walked a 10k faster than I can run it. </p>
<p>One last suggestion – since we are a relatively small community, let's try 
not to eat each other up, on this discussion group or anywhere else. </p>
<p>Now I will return to my preferred status in the shadows. But if I can be 
helpful in any way, contact me at brucepfi@aol.com </p>
