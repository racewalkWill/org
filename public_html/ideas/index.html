<h2><a name="evidence"></a>The Evidence</h2>
<p>Okay, I'm ranting again on an old subject that of the fading number of elite 
walkers in the U.S. But, following the the dearth of elite walkers at three 
national in October and having just input the results of the Chinese Nationals, 
where the depth of performance was amazing to our eyes, in to next issue of the 
Ohio Racewalker, I felt moved to share with the group a few words that concluded 
that report. It begins after my brief description of the Chinese 50. Thirteen 
finished under 4 hours. </p>
<p>By comparison, the U.S. has had only nine athletes under 4 hours ever. And 
none since 2004. As a matter of fact, in the past five years there have been 
only four U.S. times under 4:10 , Curt Clausen, Kevin Eastler and Philip Dunn 
twice. Likewise, at 20, where the Chinese had 17 under 1:25 in this race. The 
U.S. has only 10 all-time under that mark. And again, since 2004, when Kevin 
Eastler, Tim Seaman, and John Nunn were all under 1:23 to make the Olympic A 
standard and Curt Clausen also went under 1:25, there have been only six 
performances under 1:25, three by Eastler, two by Seaman, and one by Nunn. 
Similarly, there were thirteen Chinese women under 1:35 in this one race 
compared to seven all-time for the U.S. (And one of those being Yueling Chen who 
won Olympic gold for China before she walked for the U.S.) Since 2004, only 
Joanne Dow (three times) and Teresa Vail (twice) have been under that mark, and, 
as we know, they are both in their mid 40s. Okay, that's my statement for today 
on the state of U.S. racewalking. </p>

<h2><a name="challenge"></a>The Challenge</h2>
<p>So, we have definitive evidence of the problem - a long term lack of elite 
walkers in the US.</p>
<p>How do we makeover our sport?</p>
<p>I suggest that we, the members of this group, try to come up with an 
approach. Other well intentioned groups have tried, and for a variety of reasons 
have had little impact on the problem. Since the problem seems a little 
intractable (at least without a magic wand), I suggest that this group do a 
little brainstorming to throw a bunch of ideas out there, then we could talk 
about each idea and try to settle on a small number of approaches.</p>
<p>For those of you that have never been a part of a brainstorming session, 
there are only a couple of rules:</p>
<ol>
	<li>put out any idea that comes to mind (even if it sounds a little crazy or 
	undoable)</li>
	<li>no criticism of other ideas (the discussion of the relative worth of the 
	ideas is done after the brainstorming)</li>

<p><a name="idea training camp 1"></a>Training Camp 1</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: To a lesser degree than <a href="#idea training center">Training 
	Centers</a>, but still important, camps played a significant role in the US 
	program from the early 80's on through the mid-90's when we lost the track 
	at Colorado Springs. These were key motivators as we were able to host 
	senior and junior level athletes at the same time for a week to train, be 
	tested, learn new things (physiologically and psychologically), mentor 
	younger athletes and team build (watching Maryanne fly down the bowling 
	alley with her hand stuck in the bowling ball was hilarious.)</p></b>
	<p><b>Action:</b> Susan Armenta, Jolene Moore and Loretta Schuellein-McGovern 
	have <a href="USA%20Senior%20Women%20Racewalking%20Camp.pdf">plans</a> for a

	or in your letter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="idea training center"></a>Training Centers / Centers of Excellence</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Athletics West did it in the '80's, Gags at Georgetown in the 90's, 
	LaGrange for walkers in the 90's and the growth of Centers in the late 90's. 
	USOTC successes in the 80's and Chula Vista in the late 90's were key 
	factors to success in our walking program at the time. After college I hoped 
	to move to Colorado Springs, that door slammed shut due to mismanagement. We 
	re-opened the door with the success of LaGrange to Chula Vista and netted a 
	bronze medal and 3 &quot;A&quot; standard 20km men. It is a proven formula for success 
	if done properly. Ultimately, the USOC and USATF will always fail because of 
	politics, lack of long term thinking and management. (In management I refer 
	to proper discipline by athletes in Colo Springs and isolation with back 
	biting in Chula Vista.)</p>
	<p>Info: The prize money and the training groups to go after the money are 
	very much linked. In LaGrange we were able to create situations where there 
	were incentives to achieve. Together Carl S. and Allen J came up with travel 
	funding from USATF for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; standard levels. In '96 at the 50K 
	Trials, Duracell was brought in as a sponsor to up the overall prize money 
	and a large portion of that was toward an &quot;A&quot; standard bonus to be split 
	among those who made the standard. My goal was not to walk too fast, but to 
	win and do so under 4 hours. It may seem as a shrewd goal, but I didn't want 
	to share the money with anyone and it wasn't the most important race of the 
	year, the Olympics were! </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, some of us never had the opportunity to train full time 
	and were put at a significant disadvantage in relationship with our 
	international competition. Finishing 24th in '96, you'd be hard pressed to 
	find any of the men in front of me that could claim they even worked 20 
	hours a week, let alone 30-35. You just can't do it in our event and remain 
	competitive. </p>
	<p>If you want to help our &quot;event&quot; in the U.S. support an initiative to 
	start a Center of Excellence. To heck with USATF or the USOC we will get 
	NOWHERE if we think they will help. The racewalking Executive Committee is trying 
	to address this issue and get something started – probably outside of USATF 
	as the Nowhere is written on the wall. A LaGrange type of community would be 
	an ideal situation (good weather, educational opportunities, small town – 
	big fish small pond philosophy.) With several promising prospects on the 
	horizon now is the time for action, can a medal be had in Rio? It's about 
	6-1/2 years away….</p>
	<p>Info: When I referred to training camps [his comments involving
	<a href="#info alvia gaskill marathon">speakers at marathons</a> has been 
	adjusted], I meant permanent operations like Chula Vista or LaGrange, not 
	the weekend at Bernie's affairs that pass for them now. This requires 
	outside money and it's not there now and given the economy won't be there in 
	the future either. Name all the rich (I mean really rich) people interested 
	in racewalking. </p>
	<p>The Chula Vista site was set up specifically for this purpose and should 
	be used for it. The USOC (remember them, Chicago?) ought to be instructed, 
	perhaps by the WH on why they are allowed to exist. Barack is none too 
	pleased with that
	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/sports/04usoc.html">disaster in 
	Copenhagen</a> [Chicago's 2016 Olympic bid going down in flames] and as he 
	seeks to restructure our failed Olympic movement, now is a good time to 
	bring this up. </p>
	<p>Or, we could simply rent out

	Francisco Fernandez</a>' house. [aside - this may not be possible as 
	Francisco is still an active racewalker on the Spanish national team. He 
	would make a good training partner, if we could figure out how to keep him 
	in sight.]</p>

	prices</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="idea video coach"></a>Idea: Provide video technique coaching</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Most racewalkers do not have a skilled racewalk technique coach 
	available. We should offer technique coaching based on a video provided by 
	the athlete. The video could be uploaded to the web, then viewed by one or 
	more video coaches. Match the skill level of the coach with the skill level 
	of the athlete to get the most leverage and the best results. This should be 
	a fee-for-service activity, enabling the coaches to be paid for their time 
	and expertise. This would be an excellent follow-up service to a training 
	camp.</p>
	<p>Info: this is happening already in a slightly different form, but making 
	what is going on visible, and accessible by others that are not &quot;in the 
	know&quot; would help. This is especially important as we grow racewalking 
	participation.</p>

	racewalkers, and give the top young women/men some coaching/mentoring

	<p>Info: a Jr training camp is organized already in December of each year.</p>
	<p>Info: what about holding a traditional summer time, youth, sports camps? 
	There are already a couple of racewalk camps that target masters. Keep young 
	people interested by offering them the opportunity to improve their skills 
	and to meet other young walkers. Often these camps in other sports (think

<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Stop brainstorming and start actually doing something to get kids 
	racewalking and keep them racewalking. Stop typing messages here and go to 
	a school, any school, and give a free lesson on our event. Get all of those 
	kids into a program where they train 2-3x a week with your club and then 
	have races for them too. This is the formula that every other activity in 
	the US uses to get people involved. It's not rocket science &amp; no think tank 
	is needed to come up with an action plan with an organizational mission 
	statement. Simply, the answer is go do something. Once you have, go do it 
	again &amp; again &amp; again.</p>
	<p>Info: I (Steve Vaitones) worked with a club this past year. All 200 kids 
	tried it the first two week - just 200 meters. It was hard and that made an 
	impression. 60 kids walked the 400 meters 9 of 10 sessions to get a 
	participation medal. Judging wasn't enforced until the last 4 sessions. 
	Several decided on their own to do longer walks, up to 2 miles, at practice. 
	After the 6 week club session, the club had about 40 kids overall compete 
	later ito the summer including Jr Olympics. 12 raced at the association or 
	Regional meet. 4 went to Nationals 2 were disqualified (but finished with 
	PR's) One medaled. They're running XC and doing other sports this fall. They 
	might train some and race indoors. The best 2 kids for technique that tried 
	it didn't do it very much and didn't race. They were interested in other 
	things; but they do now have the basics. Working with a club requires - 
	dealing with a track and field club, not trying to start it as a walk only 
	venture - a commitment from the clinician/coach/leader - it has to be a full 
	season, not one or two 'clinics' - a sit-down with the coach to work out a 
	season long plan, and following _their_ lead in many cases - patience, and 
	working on the level of the kids out for the club. You don't focus on being 
	an Olympian 10 years down the road; that's longer than many have been alive. 
	- recognizing that kids do a lot of things and walking is only one event. In 
	fact you want to encourage a wide range of participation for a well-rounded 
	athlete. It's far easier than trying to make introductions and inroads with 
	a school system - public, private, charter, parochial - and the clubs are 
	already in our organization. It does take work, but the basics and structure 
	are already there. And even if none every walk beyond youth, at least there 
	is a population that now has a knowledge and appreciation of the event. I 
	couldn't do any more than one club in a year. </p>
	<p>Info: I (Tom Menendez) have a JO club in Auburn, Maine that does the same 
	thing. Everyone tries the racewalk as part the regular events and then 
	tries the event at track meets. It is very difficult for some of the kids to 
	grasp and a godsend for others who can't seem to find success in any other 
	event. In the last 3 years the walkers have garnered 60 points at the state 
	meet. The program has also produced an indoor mile National chanp, Penn 
	Relay junior champ, 2 1-hour junior national champs, 2 members of the junior 
	national and 15 high school All-Americans, indoor and outdoor. It takes 
	time, dedication, desire and commitment to get these kids going and keep

<p><a name="idea schools"></a>Idea: Work with K-12 schools</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Each of us could work and train the elementary school coaches in 
	our areas where we live so that they in turn can introduce thousands and 
	thousands of children to racewalking. We could then follow through with our 
	middle and high school coaches and eventually inundate our NAIA colleges 
	with enough elite walkers to allow them to want to train their coaches in 
	our beautiful sport. Currently, many of our kids trained during their early 
	years are running into a brick wall. Our colleges are not prepared for them 
	because we do not have enough of these kids at their front door. </p>
	<p>Info: Steve Viatones mentions that working with a club is &quot;far easier 
	than trying to make introductions and inroads with a school system but that 
	he couldn't do more than one club in a year.&quot; I too agree that its easier 
	and I too could not do more than one club in a year, therefore, would it not 
	be best for us to spend more time teaching the elementary school coaches so 
	that they in turn can coach their kids? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Idea enlist"></a>Idea: enlist existing coaches/teachers as racewalk 
coaches</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Tim, Dave, Gary and others have traveled down to our unforgotten part of 
	our country (as Dave said) and helped us teach our elementary school coaches 
	at our PSJA and Edinburg School Districts. Twelve of the twenty-six PSJA 
	coaches spend three weeks teaching their kids racewalking last year and we 
	now have a commitment from all to teach racewalking again this year. 
	Furthermore, racewalking will now be contested at our upcoming cross country 
	elementary school meet in February and the twenty-six elementary school 
	coaches in Edinburg will also now start teaching racewalking this year. </p>
	<p>I do not think that many of these fifty-two elementary school coaches 
	will be able to teach racewalking to their kids with the same 'gusto' that 
	many of us do, but they, as a group, will reach and introduce racewalking to 
	many more thousands than we can ever dream of individually teaching 
	ourselves. Who knows, we might even get some of these school coaches to 
	volunteer to start teaching racewalking in summer as we do. There is only so 
	much that our small community of racewalking coaches can do. We need help 
	and I think this is a good way to get it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="idea intro materials"></a>Idea: Introductory materials for a 
club/school/parent</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Create a collection of materials that assists a club, coach, 
	teacher or parent in introducing kids to racewalking. Cover not only how to 
	teach the technique, and basic training practices, but how to keep the kids 
	interested in racewalking. AC already has put some of this into a book. 
	Others have experience that could be added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="idea cross train"></a>Idea: Cross Train - Encourage wide ranging 
participation in sports</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Our racewalking team just completed a five week intensive swimming 
	program with beautiful results and I certainly recommend that all coaches 
	consider the same program on their off-season. Some of our children have 
	done well in the past and I attribute part of their success because they are 
	active swimmers. In fact, I think many of our National elite racewalkers 
	have been active swimmers at one time or another. Steve Viatones has brought 
	up many good points including the fact that a child should be encouraged to 
	obtain a wide range of participation (in other sports) for a well rounded 
	athlete and I agree. Many of our kids are also active in school tract, cross 
	country, basketball etc. </p>

racewalking, and sometimes you will find somebody like Trevor, who flourishes in

<blockquote>
	<p >Info: The perception among runners, especially the ones posting on

always starting a thread on <a href="http://www.letsrun.com/">letsrun.com</a> bashing racewalking. I think we have 
seen that even an up and coming elite racewalker like Trevor B. has experienced 
bias against racewalk. Somehow we have to change this perception, and that is a hard 
thing to do. I have communicated with Robert Johnson, assistant track coach at 
Cornell, and co-founder (with his twin) of <a href="http://www.letsrun.com/">letsrun.com</a>, and he is not 
particularly enamored of racewalk, although not aggressive against it (as far as I can

<p><a name="idea local races"></a>Idea: Work with Race Directors</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Info: Contact local area fitness race 
organizers and persuade them to include a racewalk element.</p>
	<p><b>Action: </b>MDRA (Minnesota Distance Runners Association) has agreed 
	to add a racewalk category to all of their events in 2010 - unless the 
	course is unsuitably hilly. Twin Cities Race Walkers is providing 
	walking judges. There are now awards this year, just a presence in the 
	results lists. -- Dave Daubert</p>
	<p><b>Action:</b> MDRA sponsors a race directors meeting in January. One of 
	the topics covered will be &quot;Walkers - the Forgotten Market&quot; which addresses 
	idea of attracting more participants to a road race by catering to the 
	ordinary walker. Studies in MN show that there are more walkers than 
	runners, so the economics support this approach. This is not targeted at 
	racewalking, but once walking divisions are recognized and economically 
	viable, racewalking and judging can follow -- Bruce Leasure</p>
	<p>Info: Listening to John Bingham a bit this weekend at a Rock N Roll 
	Marathon clinic, a thought struck me (and I might be a bit bruised for it). 
	He was addressing the recent success of US Marathoners with Meb winning the 
	NYC Marathon and Ryan Hall coming in fourth. He observed that it is due in 
	part because of the sheer numbers of people now participating in marathons. 
	That with that much participation we just get better. OK, that's not such a 
	big revelation, but hear me out. </p>
	<p>John Bingham was also the starter for this race, in which there were some 
	31,000+ participants. It had a wave start in which approximately 500 
	entrants started each 60-90 seconds. With each wave, John said &quot;Runners and 
	WALKERS get ready. . .&quot; Lots of walkers in these events. </p>
	<p>I'm not savvy about the Who's Who of running, so I didn't recognize all 
	the names on the list of clinic speakers this weekend. But I know that Frank 
	Shorter was also there. We're trying to figure out how to attract more 
	participants to our sport. Why not go where the people are? They're not just 
	at track meets in high schools or college. They're at these huge events. Any 
	chance one (or more) of you could be a regular clinic speaker at the Expos 
	of these huge events? </p>
	<p><a name="info alvia gaskill marathon"></a>Info: There have been lots of people running marathons for decades. Our 
	[marathon] recent improvement has been due to support from a handful of people who set 
	up <a href="#idea training center">training centers</a>. The [marathon] performances in NY were overhyped as this is a post 
	Olympic year and the fields were weaker than normal, not stronger. Still, we 
	have a credible marathon program for the time being. Obviously not the case 
	for walking. BTW, I wouldn't invite Shorter to speak on behalf of walking. 
	He hates it. Having someone speak would, however be a good idea for general 
	publicity, but I doubt it gets us any closer to the podium. Anyone want to 
	set up a <a href="#idea training center">training center</a>?</p>
	<p><b>Action</b>: With Dave McG's permission, I sent the below e-mail to the Las 
	Vegas RnR organizers. I think we should try to keep after this idea of 
	having Dave and other racewalk coaches and notables speak at the free 
	clinics at race Expos. If you will be participating in marathons in the 
	future, please consider sending a similar e-mail to the race organizers. The 
	more we get the word out about racewalking, the more of us there will be. 
	Who knows, maybe the US will eventually become a racewalking powerhouse! --

	<blockquote>
		<p>I am a racewalker who will earn the 2009 Super Six award at Las 
		Vegas. Many walkers do Rock 'N' Roll events but your clinic speakers 
		really speak just to runners. We would love to hear from someone who 
		could speak to the specific concerns of the many walkers who participate 
		in Rock N Roll events. May I suggest Dave McGovern, who will already be 
		in Las Vegas as Team Challenge's National Walk Coach. </p>
		<p>A little about Dave from his web site: </p>
		<p>Dave McGovern is the most experienced and productive racewalking 
		coach and clinician in the US, and perhaps the world. A 22+ year veteran 
		of the US National Racewalk Team with a master's degree in sport science 
		from the United States Sports Academy. Dave has conducted some 20 
		clinics and camps per year throughout North America as well as Europe, 
		South and Equatorial Africa, since 1991. Many of Dave's clinic alumni 
		have lost weight, bounced back from heart disease and diabetes, 
		completed marathons and many have won masters racewalking championships 
		and set age-group world records. </p>
		<p>During his 25-year competitive career Dave won 13 U.S. National 
		Championships and walked 20 kilometers (12.4 miles--one of the two 
		Olympic distances for men) in 1:24:29--a 6:48 per-mile pace--which ranks 
		him as the fastest American ever to not make an Olympic Team. (Onward to 
		2012!) A member of 18 International Teams, including six World Cup and 
		six Pan Am Cup teams, Dave competed at the junior 10K at the US Olympic 
		Trials in 1984 and in either the 20k or 50k (or both) as a senior in 
		every Olympic Trials since 1988. </p>
		<p>As a private coach, Dave has had ten athletes qualify for the United 
		States Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials. Dave also coaches the national team 
		of Ghana, West Africa, and was one of the two coaches for the U.S. team 
		at the 2008 World Cup of Racewalking in Cheboksary Russia. Dave is 
		currently the National (U.S. and Canada) Coach for the Crohn's and 
		Colitis Foundation's Team Challenge Half-Marathon Walk Team, as well as 
		their Long Island, NY Run Coach. </p>

<blockquote>
	<p >Info: Consistency is important. Some say racewalk is not a sport, 
	but an event in Track &amp; Field (known internationally as Athletics). The USATF 
	website has a list of &quot;sports&quot; on the grey menu bar near the top of the main

	<p >Info: Encourage &quot;racewalk&quot;

	to identify racewalking references, as two words are looked at individually

	and web sites under USATF control so that racewalk is spelled as one word. 
	Contact major racewalking websites and clubs so they change their wording to 
	(be sure to explain why in this contact). Make this change in the USATF

	for&nbsp; South. </p>
	<p>Info: At least 50% of the USATF Associations do not contest a racewalk

	Not sure how to encourage them, but sending a press release that told a 
	similar story to the article in the Arizona Republic to each of the major TV 
	stations in Minneapolis/StPaul MN has resulted in 2 stations each spending 
	about 5 minutes of air time on racewalking. So, that is 5 years of trying, 2 
	press releases per year, 4 TV stations in the Twin Cities. We scored 2/40 -- 
	which is just good enough to keep me sending out the press releases.. Each 
	time they aired, the club got more inquiries and more people came to our
