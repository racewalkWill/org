<h2>Restructure prize money to encourage 
performance<span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="2"> - updated Nov 24, 2009

<blockquote>
	<p>Info: provide significant prize money for performance - at not only IAAF 
	A and B standard levels, but also on the path to get there.</p>
	<p>Info: providing a LOT of prize money for one or two events a year might 
	attract more quality athletes to the sport. Consider what would happen if 
	$5,000,000 in prize money was offered for winning the 20km championship. It 
	seems plausible that at least some quality endurance runners would attempt 
	to learn racewalking for the chance at the prize. Who wants to ask Bill 
	Gates or Warren Buffett for support?</p>
	<p>Info: Fame, Fortune and Winning are three of the major driving forces for 
	elite athletes.</p>
	<p>Info: below a certain level, prize money does not cover the expenses of 
	the walker coming to the event. At this point, the prize money is not a 
	factor in drawing people to the event. If they are coming anyway, it is a 
	nice perk. Airfare and hotel will cost around $500 per event. Providing 
	rooms (in the event hotel, or in a local person's home) is one way to reduce 
	the cost of the event from the athletes point-of-view. This allows the prize 
	money to be lower, and still be a draw.</p>
	<p>Info: Success in Marathons / Prize Money - About 15 years ago a group of 
	race directors and other interested parties took it upon themselves to 
	dedicate resource and find monies for prize money to support U.S. distance 
	athletes. The program began paying dividends in 2004 with the obvious 
	success in Athens. USATF played no significant role in this programs 
	success, it's only the benefactor. Prize money works if it is consistent and 
	scaled with incentives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several approaches to prize money have been suggested. Considering the 
current skill level of US racewalkers, which prize money structure enumerated 
below would </p>
<ul>
	<li>encourage walkers to come to the event?</li>
	<li>encourage walkers to walk faster?</li>
	<li>encourage walkers to walk further at higher speeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the suggestions -- consider the target time or target pace something 
that has to be carefully selected.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Traditional method - $$ to top 3 or top 6 <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pure performance bonus - money for obtaining some target time. Key 
	factor here is to select the target time at an appropriate degree of 
	difficulty for the distance and the current skill level of US walkers.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Traditional method with performance bonus - $$ to top 3 or top 6 - and 
	then bonus money for obtaining some target time. This method of awarding 
	prize money is pretty standard, so there should not be much push-back from 
	the athletes. If we can get the target time right, then this will encourage 
	people to do the work to walk faster. The key -- picking the right target 
	time --<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Special short event performance - have a 1km event&nbsp; on the day 
	prior to a minor Championship (for example, the 15k or the 30k). Give prize 
	money (say $500 each) to the fastest 5 men/women over the target speed. This 
	could be done either as a race, or as a time-trial format (launch one walker 
	every 30 seconds or so).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Select your distance performance bonus - have a variety of distances, 
	say every km from 1-20, each with its own target time. Each walker trying 
	for prize money selects a distance. The goal is for them to achieve the 
	target time for that distance. As the distance goes up, the prize money goes 
	up. Say, $100 for each km. [for example, If the target time was based on 
	IAAF 20k B pace,&nbsp; a woman could select 8k, then if she walks the 8k in 
	less than 39:12 (8k at IAAF women's 20k B pace) she would win $800]. This 
	way an athlete could select a distance that was appropriate for their skill 
	level, training state, and tolerance for risk.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Action</b>: the organizers of USA 15km Open/Jr Racewalking Championships 
(hosted in MN) tried something that didn't work in 2009. It was essentially a 
select your distance performance bonus with available distances of 5k, 10k, and 
15k, with the additional requirement that you had to complete the 15k. The 
target time was IAAF 20km B pace. The requirements were too difficult for the 
time of year and the current skill level of US racewalkers. The organizers of 
the 15k are committed to finding a better approach for 2010. We need help in 
selecting and approach, and for establishing target times that are challenging 
but not impossible for the current crop of US racewalkers. We also need help in 
getting the word out to the elite and near-elite racewalkers once the prize 
structure is finalized. -- Bruce Leasure &amp; Dave Daubert</p>

<p>Idea: Distance/Age-Graded Approach</p>
<p>I did a track meet in NY ( Stella Cashman would know more about it) at Chelse 
Piers that provide money for getting the highest percentage of reaching an 
already established record. I won the $1500 even though other track (as in 800m) 
runners were there as I had the highest percentage of an American record. They 
used American and world records but to make it more competitive you could do 
highest percentage of age group records as one category so no matter man or 
woman or what age - who ever got the closest by percentage wins. This way men, 
women and all age groups are competing against each other. </p>
<p>For example (all made up numbers and using round numbers) Sue's time for 5 K 
is 23:00 and the age group/sex record is 22:00 so she is at 95.6 % Dan's time 
for 5k was 22:00 and the age group/sex record is 21:00 so he is at 95.4% Sue 
wins the $$$ </p>
<p>You can have separate categories too to make it competitive at different 
levels so to encourage participation for beginners. </p>
<p>You can have 3 highest percentage of American record for a distance and those 
winners are excluded from the competition of the highest to American Age group 
record. </p>
<p>You could also have it over differing distances but having all start at the 
same time. Like highest percentage of age group record (and/or American record) 
for 5k, 10k and 15k and you don't have to finish the 15k to win the 5k or 10k 
$$$. That way you provide &quot;rabbits&quot; legally for the 15k walkers.</p>
<p>[aside - rabbits are specifically allowed by USATF rules -- it is called 
pacesetting -- see 2009 USATF rule book, rule 144.3(e) and rule 144.3(g)]</p>
