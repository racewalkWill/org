<h2>What is Race Walking, Anyway?</h2>
<p>Race walking is a stylized form of running, much like the backstroke is a 
stylized form of swimming. To the casual observer, race walking is clearly 
different from running, fitness walking, ordinary walking and skipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What You'll Learn - <span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">
<a href="../forms/RaceWalk101.pdf">handout</a></font></span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>what makes race walking different from running</li>
	<li>legal race walk technique - to follow the rules</li>
	<li>efficient race walk style - with <font face="Arial">&#8531;</font> the impact 
	stress of running</li>
	<li>basic components of a race walk training program</li>
	<li>how to set reasonable goals for your race walking</li>
	<li>how to adapt a training program to help you meet your goals</li>
	<li>how to select shoes for race walking</li>
	<li>how fast/far race walkers go</li>
</ul>
<p>While we can introduce you to race walking in only one hour, to really learn 
it, you have to go race walk. As you experiment with race walking technique and 
race walking style, you'll come up with more questions. That is what the club is 
good for, because you can ask your questions of the knowledgeable race walkers 
and coaches that come to every club function. There is always more to learn 
about race walking, about how your body works, and about the control that your 
mind has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who Should Come?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a break from running, you might be a race walker.</p>

race walker.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight, and have some time to spend every day, you might 
be a race walker.</p>
<p>If you like to do things that are a little bit different, you might be a race 
walker.</p>
<p>If you want to challenge your brains control of your body, you might be a 
race walker.</p>
