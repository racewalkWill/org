<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Skill Level of Athletes</h2>
<p>All skill levels of athletes are welcome. The only restriction is that you 
must be able to complete the distance that you enter before the <b>Max Time</b> 
for that day has passed. In 2006, we have had race walkers that took over 14 minutes per 
mile and race walkers that took only 7 minutes per mile. We won't let you start a new 
lap after <b>Max Time</b> has passed. See the <a href="2007Entry.htm">entry form</a> 
for the <b>Max Time</b> for each day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Type of Participation</h2>
<p>We welcome race walkers, walkers and runners to each event at the
		<font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../../jorvigpark.htm">Jorvig Park</a></font> 
course and on the <a href="../../courses/2007%20MidTown%20Greenway%202km/index.html">Greenway Trail</a> course. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two points of walking technique that differentiate race walking, 
walking and running. These two rules are carefully defined in the
<a href="http://www.usatfmn.org/racewalk/rules.htm#Rule232.2-DefinitionOfRW">
rules of race walking</a>, but here is a version that is simple to understand:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>both shoes cannot be off the ground at the same time</li>
	<li>a knee can be bent only when the shoe on the same leg is either on the ground 
	behind the body or in the air</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't follow rule 1, then you are running.</p>
<p>If you don't follow rule 2, but do follow rule 1, then you are walking.</p>
<p>If you follow both rule 1 &amp; rule 2, then you are race walking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be race walk judges on the course at all times to enforce these 
rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If 3 or more judges independently decide that you have violated the 
appropriate rules, then you are disqualified (DQed) from that type of 
participation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chief race walk judge will attempt to notify an athlete that they have 
been DQed, and give the athlete the opportunity to change their type of 
participation. We will try to make this notification during the race. If we are 
unable to notify you during the race, we will automatically adjust the type of 
participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A race walker that is DQed for violating Rule 2, can continue as a walker. A 
walker or a race walker that is DQed for violating Rule 1 can continue as a 
runner. Runners can never be DQed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bib number of each athlete is clearly marked to indicate race walking, 
walking or running. This enables other athletes to see who their competition is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Course Facilities</h2>
<p>There will be water available on a table on the course. The athletes will 
have access to this table once per lap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a table on the course for each athlete to place their own 
personal stash of sports beverage, food, and other necessities. The athletes 
will have access to this table once per lap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a DQ board. The race walk officials will post a red dot on this 
board next to an athletes bib number as soon as possible after a race walk judge 
has proposed an athlete for disqualification. The red dot will be marked to 
indicate which rule was violated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We try to provide lap times to all athletes, both during the race and 
afterwards. We recommend that you bring a wrist watch that can count laps and 
record split times as a backup. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A port-a-potty is near the start/finish line at the
<font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../../jorvigpark.htm">Jorvig Park</a></font> 
course. The Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown Hotel has agreed to let us use their 
public bathrooms for the <a href="../../courses/2007%20MidTown%20Greenway%202km/index.html">Greenway Trail</a> 
course. Please be nice to the employees and guests at the Sheraton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Course Distance</h2>
<p>On the
		<font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../../jorvigpark.htm">Jorvig Park</a></font> 
course, the 5km, 10km, 15km, 20km and 1hr events will be held on a 1.25km out-and-back loop. All 
other events are held on a 2.5km out-and-back loop. We will be converting this 
course to a 1km and 2km loop course this year, to make the lap times easier for 
people to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the
<a href="../../courses/2007%20MidTown%20Greenway%202km/index.html">Greenway Trail</a> course, all events are held on 
a 2km loop, with the start/finish line at the exact center. Sometimes we use 
only one half the course, making it a 1km loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Maximum of 1 award per person per day. If you are eligible for more than one 
award, you get to pick which you get.</p>
<p>Identical categories for men and women.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st Place</li>
	<li>1st Master (35 and older)</li>
	<li>1st Junior (14-19)</li>
	<li>1st-3rd in these age groups<ul>
		<li>10 and younger, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18</li>
		<li>19-34</li>
		<li>35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80 
		and older</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results are posted
<a href="http://twincitiesracewalkers.org/results/index.html">on the web</a>. We 
try to provide splits for each lap as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spectators and Volunteers</h2>
<p>There is plenty of space for spectators to view the action. The only good 
entry to the course is near the start/finish line. Like most small races, we can 
always use volunteers, so be warned - we will try to transform a spectator into 
a volunteer. All the tasks can be learned on race-day. It would be nice if every 
participant could bring a volunteer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hotels</h2>
<p>If the event is held on the <a href="../../jorvigpark.htm">Jorvig Park course</a>, the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sl/1/en/hd/mspia">Holiday Inn 
Select Airport</a> 952-854-9000 is reasonably priced (from $91), near the 
airport, near the Mall of America, and an easy drive to the course. It also has 
one of the finest fitness centers I've ever seen in a hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the event is held on the <a href="../../courses/2007%20MidTown%20Greenway%202km/index.html">Greenway Trail 
course</a>,&nbsp; the Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown Hotel, 2901 Chicago Avenue 
South, Minneapolis, MN 55407 is at the west end of the course. Call (612) 
821-7600 for reservations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Race Walk Judging</h2>
<p>If you are a race walk judge and are looking for some more experience for the 
resume, we would love to have you come judge. If you are new to race walk 
judging and want to shadow-judge a race, we can assign you an experience judge 
as a mentor. If you can, please let
<a href="mailto:info@twincitiesracewalkers.org?subject=Race Walk Judge a TCRW event">Bruce Leasure</a> 
that you are coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Video Taping</h2>
<p>Feel free to have someone come and video tape you, or any others during the 
race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On some races, we will have a mobile video platform on the course that will 
parallel each walker for extended periods of time. After the race, we retire to 
a local eatery and view the video taken during the race. It is the best way to 
see what your body is really doing.</p>
