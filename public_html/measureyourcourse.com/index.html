	<font face="Times New Roman">If you are putting on an event 
	that involves a course on roads or trails, then we have some products and 
	services that will help you put on a quality event, and that will help you 
	build a loyal following for your events.</font><h3>
	<font face="Times New Roman"><a name="certify"></a>Course Measurement</font></h3>
	<p>
	We provide you with a certification course map, including a detailed 
	description of the location of the start, finish, splits, and any 
	turnarounds. We also provide a &quot;kml&quot; file for
	<a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> that shows the course 
	and the location of the start, finish, splits, and any turnarounds.<p>
	We will measure your course so accurately that it will be eligible for
	<a href="http://www.usatf.org/events/courses/">certification by USA Track &amp; 
	Field</a> (USATF). You can publish the certification number in your event 
	literature to let prospective participants know that they will be competing 
	on an accurately measured course. With the certification map, your 
	volunteers will be able to reliably setup the course, year after year. We 
	will submit all of the paperwork to get your course certified. The only 
	reason that USATF will not certify your course is if more than 50% of it is 
	on non-paved surfaces. The certification of a course is valid for 10 years.<p>
	If you enter enough events, eventually you will encounter one where the mile 
	splits are not in the right place, or where everyone gets a really fast (or 
	slow) time. These are all symptoms of either an inaccurately measured course 
	or a carelessly setup course, or both. Be a race director that cares - get 
	your courses certified.<p>We use the <i>calibrated bicycle method</i> as the 
	primary measuring technique. After equipping a bicycle with a decimeter 
	accurate odometer, we ride a very carefully measured calibration course four 
	times. We adjust the internal setting of the odometer to the appropriate 
	value, then validate that it is correct by riding the calibration course 
	again. Then, we go to your course and measure it twice. The first time we 
	layout the start, finish, splits and any turnaround, and the second time we 
	validate that they are all in the right place. Then we go back to the 
	calibration course and ride it four more times, just to make sure nothing 
	has changed. Then we permanently mark the location of the start, finish, 
	splits, and any turnaround using surveyor grade PK nails.</p>
	<p>We use two backup measuring techniques:
	<a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> paths and GPS. Neither 
	is acceptable by USATF as a primary measuring technique, but they do help 
	keep us from making mistakes. </p>
	<p>For well defined courses with up-to-date satellite imagery, we construct 
	a <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> path that lays out the 
	course and all splits before measuring the course. That way, we know the 
	approximate location of all of the start, finish, splits, and any 
	turnarounds before we get to the course and can verify that we are in the 
	expected place when we are out measuring with the calibrated bike.</p>
	<p>We carry a GPS on the bike when we are measuring. GPS is not nearly as 
	accurate as the decimeter accurate odometer, as any point that the GPS 
	records will have an error of at least plus or minus 7 meters. GPS is an 
	excellent approximation tool, however, and we use it to make sure that we 
	have not made a major mistake somewhere.&nbsp; We track not only the path we 
	are taking, but we also record a waypoint for the start, finish, splits, and 
	any turnaround. We import the GPS information into
	<a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>. If we were able to 
	construct a <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> path of the 
	course prior to measuring, we compare it with the path from the GPS to see 
	if everything is about the same. If we were not able to construct a
	<a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> path, we use the path 
	information from the GPS to build one. </p>
	<p>We verify that are notes about the locations of the start, finish, splits 
	and any turnarounds are consistent with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">
	Google Earth</a> path.</p>
	<p>When everything checks out, we submit the paperwork to USATF to certify 
	the course.</p>
	<h3><a name="structure"></a>Start/Finish Structures</h3>
	<p>A start/finish structure is something that holds a banner over the course 
	at a particular point. It is commonly used at the start and at the finish of 
	the course. Two banners can be hung on each structure - one facing the 
	participants as they traverse the course, and the other facing the 
	photographer taking pictures of the faces of participants. </p>
	<p>The banner facing the participants is used to indicate to the 
	participants where they are on the course. A large START banner answers a 
	lot of questions prior to race start, and a large FINISH banner provides a 
	clear indication of the goal as participants near the end of the course.</p>
	<p>The banner facing the photographer taking pictures of the faces of the 
	participants will be immortalized in a large number of photographs taken at 
	the event - both by spectators and event photographers. This banner gives 
	you an opportunity to advertise your event, or your sponsors, or both.</p>
	<p>Our start/finish structures are made from PVC pipe. They are easily 
	transportable in an SUV or the back seat of most 4-door sedans. They are 
	light weight, so almost any volunteer can carry them. One person can 
	assemble and disassemble the structure without tools. Banners are attached 
	to the structure before it is erected, eliminating the need for a ladder. 
	Raising/lowering the structure is most easily done with 3 people. Directions 
	are included.</p>
	<p>The standard structure is 12' across (the width of a single lane of 
	traffic or a typical bike path). The banner on the standard structure is 3' 
	high by 12' wide. The bottom edge of the banner is 8' above the ground (high 
	enough that people don't jump up and try to hit it when they run under it). 
	Custom widths up to 26' have been constructed and used.</div>

<p>There are at least two types of banner material that work well -- solid vinyl 
and mesh. While mesh banners are slightly more expensive, we recommend them 
because they significantly reduce the wind load on the structure. In May of 
2009, we erected a finish structure for the
<a href="http://www.walkonmn.org/marathon/">We Walk! Marathon &amp; Half</a> on a 
day with
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/walkonmn.org/WeWalkMarathonHalf?feat=directlink#5336828386589045522">
25 mph sustained winds</a>. The
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/walkonmn.org/WeWalkMarathonHalf?feat=directlink#5336828401191973330">
structure and banner</a> stayed up for
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/walkonmn.org/WeWalkMarathonHalf?feat=directlink#5336828403436613186">
6 hours</a>, enduring gusts up to 35 mph.</p>
<h3><a name="signs"></a>Signs &amp; Mile Markers</h3>
<p>There is always stuff along a course that you want to tell the participants 
about. Our signs are easy to setup, easy to read,&nbsp; sturdy enough to handle 
wind/rain/snow and reusable.</p>
<p>Our signs are printed on an 11&quot; high by 8 1/2&quot; wide brightly colored 
cardstock which is then laminated to add stiffness and water proofing. We can 
print almost anything on the sign. In addition to mile markers, km markers and 
course direction arrows, we can provide where-to-go signs for registration, 
packet pickup, bathrooms, the start, etc. We can provide two-sided signs 
(especially useful for the where-to-go signs).</p>
<p>The sign is then affixed to a 3' tall plastic fence post with a metal spike 
in the bottom. On days when the ground is not frozen, you just push the spike 
into the ground. When the ground is frozen, take a battery operated drill and 
drill a 3/8&quot; hole into the ground and then insert the spike. When there is no 
dirt around to push the spike into the plastic fence post that we use is not an 
ideal solution. (Though you can duct tape or tie the post to something solid. 
We've used weighted traffic cones, city sign posts, parking meter posts and 
telephone poles to hold signs. Please don't use duct tape on a car!)</p>
<p>The 3' tall post provides adequate visibility for low density environments 
where people are moving (for example, on a 5k race course with 250 people). When 
the density of people is high or they are standing around (for example, at 
packet pickup in a 5k race with 1000 people), you have to put the sign above 
head height, so the people in front do not block the sign.</p>
<h3><a name="race_day"></a>Race Day Course Management</h3>
<p>Setting up and taking down a course on race day is something that is most 
easily done with an experienced person in charge. If you can provide a couple of 
volunteers and the necessary traffic cones, we can provide an experienced person 
to handle course setup and taking down a course.</p>
