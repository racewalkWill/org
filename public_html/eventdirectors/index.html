<a href="mailto:info@twincitiesracewalkers.org?subject=TCRW Event Directors - suggestions">
Suggestions on how to make the material more clear are welcomed.</a> On our 
to-do list already are a&nbsp; photograph of a sample sign, a photograph of our 
finish line frame and our club banner hanger, a photograph of a coned 
turn-around as well as creating on-line versions of the forms we use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racewalkers need judged racewalking events to improve, but there are not very 
many of us. Even the national championship events draw less than 100 
racewalkers. Is there a way to put on local racewalking events that are self 
supporting monetarily and place reasonable demands on the volunteers and the 
event organizers? Of course, the answer is yes, or we would not have written 
this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Overview of a Solution</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What follows is a collection of ideas and suggestions that have worked. Most 
of the ideas come from our experienced race directors that have a combined 40 
years of experience in putting on running and race walking events. Others are 
successful techniques that we have either observed, or that were related to us 
by other event directors. You will have to apply the ideas described here to 
your specific situation, but the ideas will give you a place to start. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will notice that we put time into planning and one-time activities so 
that what happens on race day is simpler or easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important trick is to learn from each event you put on. Look at what 
is taking time, or effort, or lots of volunteers, or anything else that is 
annoying or error prone. Once you see what the problem is, you have to be 
creative and come up with a resolution that does not create more issues. The 
management types call this continuous self improvement. I call it common sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twin Cities racewalkers does not lay claim to any of the ideas presented 
here. We borrow good ideas from any event we see using them. Some of the ideas 
we learned so long ago we don't have any recollection where they came from. 
Please feel free to use these ideas, or versions of these ideas, for putting on 
your own events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you come up with other good ideas, please send us an e-mail describing 
your idea and include a note on how it works in practice. We'll add it to the 
web pages, and give you credit as bringing the idea to our attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put on an annual series of judged racewalks, targeting local racewalkers, 
that have reasonable entry fees, that are monetarily self supporting, that 
consume 3-4 volunteers per event, place easily do-able workloads on the 
volunteers, and provide a good experience for both beginning and experienced 
racewalkers. Oh yes -- we need to follow the USATF rules too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting a course is the most time consuming part of putting on a racewalk. 
It sounds like it would be easy, just look for a nice flat place to put a 1km 
loop, and you are done, but there are other considerations that can save you 
lots of time and money in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want a course </p>
<ol>
	<li>that is easy to setup and take down, </li>
	<li>that does not have a lot of other traffic (cars, bikers, roller-bladers, 
	runners) on the course or crossing the course, </li>
	<li>that does not cost a lot to use </li>
	<li>that helps get the city or park district to help - because you are 
	promoting a friendly use of a lightly used public space </li>
	<li>that has a bathroom or port-a-potty nearby</li>
	<li>that is great for racewalking -- flat, smooth, tree covered, nice easy 
	turns, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use light-traffic rail-to-trail paths that do not have road crossings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made an arrangement with the railroad that owns the path for our use, then 
took that arrangement to the park district that issues the permits, and got a 
steeply discounted rate (free at one of our courses and $1 at the other), 
because we already had the railroad's support and permission. It helps to have a 
railroad buff on your side! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We picked a section of the trail next to a lightly used city park, and then 
talked the city into providing a port-a-potty at the park to serve the park, the 
trail, and, of course, us. We picked a small suburb - that may have increased 
the chances that the city would be helpful. But most cities are interested in 
increasing &quot;correct&quot; use of their parks. You just have to find the right way to 
approach them. Port-a-johns cost about $100 each here, so this is a significant 
savings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layout a 1km loop course (for races up to 10k) and a 2km loop course for 
longer races. Any other distance makes giving understandable timing splits to 
people too hard to do. With a 1km loop course, it is easy for the athlete to get 
1km splits. For the 2km course, put the start/finish line in the exact center - 
this way you can still get 1km splits. It works best to have the start/finish 
line in the middle of the 1km course too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth the time, trouble, and expense to have the course certified by 
USATF. A certified course gives the racewalkers a course that is a reliable 
length, and you'll need it to be certified when you start to report results. If 
you have a little engineering background, or are adventuresome, you can do this 
yourself and save some money. Contact your local USATF Association course 
certifier for assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to tell the person certifying the course that you want to minimize 
the number of cones needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have the person that certifies the course clearly mark the turns and the 
start/finish so they are easy to find in the wee-hours of the morning when you 
are setting up. Here, they use &quot;PK&quot; nails (just a nail with a large head) driven 
into the pavement to mark points on a certified course. At the start of each 
year, we paint a &quot;dot&quot; about 2&quot; in diameter on top of each nail head with 
brightly colored spray paint to make them easy to find. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it is a rail-to-trail path, and our section is really straight, the 
only cones we need are at the turn-arounds. A simple painted semi-circle and 4 
cones at each end, and presto. We use landscape spray-chalk to mark the pavement 
for the turn-arounds. It washes off in the first rain, so the park district 
doesn't mind, but gives a clear border for the walkers at the turn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we picked a lightly used trail without road crossings, we don't use 
any road guards at all. We just put some <a href="#signs">signs</a> up at either 
end of the course warning non-racewalkers that happen to come our way to &quot;watch 
out for racewalkers&quot;, and we share the path with them. We purposely pick an 
early start time on Saturday/Sunday morning for our races to keep the number of 
other users of the path low. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are expecting people to come that need a hotel, it is good to have a 
hotel adjacent to your course. We have that at one of our courses, but not at 
the other. We have a recommended hotel for each course, but we don't make any 
arrangements with the hotel for discounted rates. This allows people to come to 
our race from far away, but doesn't make it a hassle for us. Except, of course, 
for the one big race we hold each year, when we do the whole event hotel, 
pre-race dinner thing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="signs"></a>Signs</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went to the local farm store and got some plastic fence poles used for 
holding move-able electric fences. We found black plastic poles with a pointed 
metal rod sticking out the bottom, and a small step sticking out the side. Just 
perfect for holding signs at about waist height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We printed signage using a computer, laminated them at Kinkos, then affixed 
the signs to the electric fence poles. Once built, we just stick them into the 
ground where we need them. We never take them apart - just keep reusing them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year we built a finish line frame out of 3&quot; PVC pipe that holds our club 
banner over the start/finish line. We made it so that it breaks down into chunks 
that easily fit into the back of a pickup truck or van,. I just store the thing 
on my garage wall when we are not using it. It takes about 5 minutes to setup at 
the race, provides a nice place to hang the club banner, a good site for 
pictures, and a little advertising to all of the people that use the path while 
the race is on. It also makes us look official rather than fly-by-night (which 
is useful if the neighbors or the park district workers or the police happen 
by.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A finish line frame also provides a spot to hang banners from sponsors -- 
when you are lucky enough to have one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you decide to build a finish line frame, make sure you design it so that 
it will handle the wind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cheaper and lighter alternative, which attaches easily to a tree or lamp 
post, is a couple of pieces of 1&quot; PVC pipe that are slightly longer than your 
banner is wide (we have a 3'x3' club banner). You tie it to the top and bottom 
edges of the banner, then tie the PVC pipes to a light pole or small tree. It 
holds the banner flat so it can be easily seen. Best of all, you don't have to 
untie the PVC pipe from the banner. just roll it all up. It doesn't hang the 
club banner over the trail or over the start/finish line, but it is a lot 
simpler to setup than a finish line frame, and almost as effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="coursesetup"></a>Course Setup</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We setup the course by dropping a few cones at the turn-arounds, a little 
spray chalk to make the path for the turn more obvious, sticking &quot;racewalkers 
crossing&quot; <a href="#signs">signs</a> a few meters further down the path to warn 
the roller-bladers, bikers, etc., stick some &quot;racewalk&quot; <a href="#signs">signs</a> 
with arrows out along the roads to direct participants to the parking, hang up 
the Twin Cities racewalkers banner, put some duct tape across the path at the 
start/finish line, and course setup is done. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a bike to get to the ends of the course to speedup setup - you'll need 
one with baskets for cones and <a href="#signs">signs</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a water station, we bring an aluminum card table. They are light weight, 
impervious to water, and stable. Set it up near the start/finish line, bring a 
water jug, pre-fill some water cups and space them out on the table so they are 
easy for the race walkers to grab. This gives the racewalkers easy access to 
water every lap. On hot days, it is good to put some ice in the water jug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also provide an aluminum card table on the other side of the path for 
walkers that want to bring their own water bottles, sports drink and food. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>On Course Music</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me, I'd rather walk in the quiet of the morning dew, but if you look at the 
number of people that are walking around with headphones on, you'll quickly come 
to the conclusion that music is important to people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is so important to one of our regular judges that he brings his Bose CD 
player, an inverter to produce 110v power from his car, and parks along the 
course and provides up-beat music for that end of the course. We always get good 
comments about the music when <a href="http://charitieschallenge.org/">Gary 
Westlund of Charities Challenge</a> comes and judges. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safety &amp; Security</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not allow headphones. We are using a shared use path, and it is 
important for people to be able to here when a bicyclist or other faster moving 
person is overtaking them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure people lock their cars. You may be in a small town. There may not 
be many other people around at that time of the morning. But you never know when 
an opportunistic thief happens to notice your group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure at least one person has a cell-phone in case you need to call 911.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Post-Race food </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We keep it simple - just some fruit which we purchase at the local grocery 
store on the way to the race. Racewalkers and volunteers take home what we don't 
eat at the race. Some event directors get a sponsor for this, but with small 
numbers of participants, it seems more trouble than it is worth. We never eat 
more than $5 with of bananas and apples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Event Sanctions </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanctioning is important because it provides insurance for the event. The 
park district or land owner may require evidence of insurance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We get all of our races at one location during the year sanctioned by USATF 
for one sanction fee, and we get the local USATF association to waive the 
association portion of the sanction fee. This is much cheaper than sanctioning 
each event separately. </p>
<p>Talk to the person that does USATF sanctions for your association and they 
should be able to tell you how to fill out the form so this happens. You have to 
ask the local association to waive their part of the fee - just tell them you 
are trying to grow participation in racewalking and need some help while the 
numbers are small. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is usually not a problem for small races. With small numbers, almost 
anything will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an entry form on our web site, but do not offer on-line registration. 
Remember to bring blank entry forms and pens to the race for race day 
registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Price &amp; Money</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price your race to minimize the type of change that you need to bring. We 
charge $10 and accept cash or checks. The standard unit of money is $20 (thanks, 
ATMs).&nbsp; This makes it simple for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setup a bank account for your events. Funnel every entry fee and every 
expense through it. This way you can keep track of profit/loss, and have a clear 
record just in case someone needs to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bib Numbers</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We only use bib numbers on the front of each participant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can usually get bib numbers for free, if you are not too picky. Just go 
to a local running store that sponsors running races and talk with the manager. 
They will most likely have some left-over bib numbers they would be happy to 
give you. If you are good at chit-chatting, you might even pick up a race 
sponsor or volunteer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Publicity</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put up a web site for your events. The web is a common method that small 
groups of people with a common interest find each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>List all of our events on the USATF calendar and on every other online 
service that runners, cross country skiers, tri-athlete, or other endurance 
sport participant in your area uses. These services are free. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-mail or talk to other racewalkers in the area. Word of mouth is a powerful 
tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth the effort to put up a banner along the trail that has your club 
name on it. People will stop and talk, and you might gain a member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We give water and fruit to anyone that stops and asks. A little thing, but 
why not? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Volunteers &amp; Judges</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do some races with 3, and some with 4 volunteers. You need at least 3 
because you need at least 3 USATF certified racewalk judges for a judged 
racewalk event. This means that the judges, or the race participants, need to 
help out with everything else, and during the race, the racewalk judges have to 
be willing to do other duties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of our racewalk judges work as racewalk judges, lap counters, course 
marshals, umpires, red card runners and public relations specialists. If you 
have someone that is used to just judging, they may resist the extra workload, 
but it really isn't that much more work, and it makes the job a little less 
boring. And judging small races can be boring because there just isn't that much 
going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We position the head racewalk judge at the start/finish line, while each of 
the other judges takes an end of the course (remember, our start/finish line is 
in the middle of the course).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either the 4th volunteer or the head racewalk judge also works as starter, 
timer, water station, verbal lap board and verbal DQ board. It takes a bit of 
practice for the head racewalk judge to multi-task all of this and judge too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We built a special judging form that is actually a lap counting form that has 
space for each judge to write down cautions and red cards too. The form has a 
row for each walker and two columns for each lap. Our course is an out-and-back 
loop, so each judge sees each walker twice on each lap. Each time a walker comes 
by, the judge writes the time of day down for this lap before the walker enters 
the judging region, then judges as normal, noting any cautions or red cards in 
the same square as the time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the judges wander around, judging at different locations on the course, 
they eventually return any red cards to the head judge at the start/finish line.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't use a physical DQ board. Instead, the head judge tells the 
racewalkers about the red cards as they are received (for example - &quot;you have 2 
red cards now - both for bent knee&quot;). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a time-machine printing timer. We enter the bib number of the walker 
and collect that with the split time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that helps the head judge multi-task is that you don't have to be 
&quot;precise&quot; on split times. You can be 20 meters away from the start/finish line, 
and still press the button when the walker is &quot;at&quot; the start/finish.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a racewalker is finishing, you just take the time machine over to the 
start/finish line and capture an &quot;exact&quot; finish time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In between racewalkers, there is enough time to pick up cups and to fill new 
cups as needed for the water station. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bring plastic trash bags and work gloves. A quick trip picking up trash on 
the trail before and after the event ensures that we are good users and don't 
irritate the park district or city or neighbors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In small races, almost everyone wins their 5-year age-group. To some people, 
the award is very important. Even if it is not important to you, it is important 
to have an award. For events that are USATF/MN championships, we get medals from 
USATF/MN to distribute at no cost to us. They only cost about $1 each anyway, 
but every little bit counts. For events that are not USATF/MN championships, we 
give out ribbons that I found at Crown Awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important award we give out is the reading of the times and ages and 
places for everyone at the end of the race. Everyone likes to be congratulated, 
and they like to have their improvements noted. This is easy to do in a small 
race ... hard to do in a big one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a company that makes or distributes bread in your town, and you 
can talk them into sponsoring your awards, you can give loaves of bread to the 
winners. Yes, I am going to say it -- it makes them bread-winners. Thanks to
<a href="http://charitieschallenge.org/">Charities Challenge</a> for this idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Distances </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At most of our events, there are multiple distances being competed. Its 
really not a problem for the volunteers, with the only one that has to know is 
timer, as you want to capture that &quot;exact&quot; finishing time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find some really big clear plastic bags. We use clear plastic garbage bags. 
Put a box of them in with the stuff you bring to the race. When it looks like 
rain, put the time-machine inside one, and give one to each judge to keep their 
paperwork dry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Racewalk Judges are Racewalkers too </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next year, we are adding an additional wrinkle. Our racewalk judges are 
racewalkers too, and they would like to compete. So, on the shorter races, we 
are going to hold two races, one after the other, and switch who is judging and 
who is racewalking. This means we have to train most of our racewalkers to be 
judges (but that is not hard, and we think it will be good for them). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, on longer races, when we had more than 3 judges, we let the judges 
walk 5km or 10km at some point during the race. There would always be 3 judges 
working as judges, it just wouldn't always be the same judges. Since judges take 
port-a-john breaks during long races anyway, it seemed like an OK extension to 
us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Feedback to the Walkers</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We run most of our events in &quot;training&quot; mode - where the judges that are also 
racewalk coaches/instructors are allowed to coach athletes during the race 
(watch your left knee, stand up straight, keep your turn-over up, etc.) We tell 
all of the racewalkers what is going to happen during the pre-start instruction 
- so they know what to expect. You have to be careful with this one -- but if 
done right, the athletes like it because they learn what the judges/coaches are 
seeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar vein, one of the judges usually video tapes each participant for 
a lap or two. After the race, we often go somewhere and schmooze, and then we 
pull out the video and show everyone what they looked like, and the judges 
explain what they saw. We make it clear at the start of the race that the video 
tape is for post-race analysis not for judging. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Racewalk Clinics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer racewalk clinics before the event - just the basics about how to 
racewalk legally. This has not been particularly successful in gaining new 
racewalkers for us, though we have had several newbies come and racewalk 
legally, but slowly, after taking the 15 minute clinic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also offer Racewalking 101 clinics a few times a year. We use 4 one-hour 
sessions to teach people the basics of racewalking and to get them out trying 
it. They work pretty well for attracting new people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
