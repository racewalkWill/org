		Bruegger's Bagels, 4953 Penn Ave S, Minneapolis, MN</a></b>
		<p>Park on the street. If you come early, come inside, get something to 
		drink, or just schmooze with the other race walkers. You choose how far, 
		how fast, and how much time you'll spend walking. We leave promptly at 
		8am. We gather a group or two of people 
		interested in walking similar speeds and distances and head out for Lake 
		Harriet, just a couple of blocks away. For the adventuresome, Lake of 
		the Isles, Lake Calhoun and the Minnehaha Parkway are nearby. Plan on 
		spending 1 to 2 hours walking at an aerobic pace. In the summer, there is quite a bit of water available on 
		all 3 lakes. In the winter, bring your own. Port-a-Potties are 
		available on both Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet all year round. After 
		your walk, gather at Bruegger's, change 
		out of your wet clothes, get something to eat and drink, and schmooze 
		with the other race walkers. Contact Person:

		Black Bear Crossing, 1300 Lexington Pkwy N, Saint Paul - just off 
		Lexington Ave at Como Lake</a></b>.
		<p>This is a day of easy walking with short bursts of faster speeds 
		thrown in for variety. We regroup and chat a bit after each 1.6 mile lap 
		of Como Lake. We adjust speeds so that we usually have only 1 or 2 
		groups of walkers. The group walks counterclockwise around the lake, so 
		if you come after 6pm, just start walking clockwise and you will find us. Bathrooms and 
		water are available at Black Bear Crossing all year round. Thanks to
